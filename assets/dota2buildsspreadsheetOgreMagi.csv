jialiya,Ogre Magi,Get Luckier,"Ogre Magi is all about getting lucky at the right times. A multicasted fireblast can easily own an enemy. If you're an unlucky person, I don't suggest you play this hero.","Ogre usually doesn't lane solo. Pairing up with another stunner can get you first blood if you guys focus on one hero. Start off with a stun and after the stun wears off, cast ignite on them to prevent them from running away. If you also have bloodlust, be sure to cast that before the fight starts. Your skills take up a good chunk of mana so don't spam it.","Your multicast makes you great at ganking other heroes. Don't forget to bloodlust your teammates before the gank.<br/>Teammate getting chased? Bloodlust them and ignite the chaser. Basically, always cast bloodlust whenever you can. ","Multicast is also great for bloodlust. You can give your entire team a buff before team fights. In team fights you can either focus on the carry or the low HP int heroes. A multicasted fireblast can kill the int heroes in one shot. It'll help your team immensely if an enemy Zeus goes down without having casted any of his spells. However, the stun on the enemy carry coupled with the multicast damage will also help your team fight. Don't cast the fireball on a tank.",,,,60,1,2,1,3,1,4,1,2,2,2,4,3,3,3,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"Iron Branch, Iron Branch, Iron Branch, Observer Ward, Clarity, Clarity, Healing Salve","Arcane Boots, Magic Wand, Aghanim's Scepter, Orb of Venom","Observer Ward, Flying Courier, Scythe of Vyse, Vladmir's Offering"
jialiya,Ogre Magi,Double or Nothing,"Ogre Magi is a great Ganker, Support, Roamer and just a solid pick in benefiting a team overall. Keep in mind a few things while playing Ogre Magi. You are still warding for your team, you are not a hard carry, you are very useful so make sure you are not absent from the majority of fights, play smart, don't be selfish, DO NOT rely on Multi Cast, treat it as a luxury proc.","As Ogre Magi they're a few ways to lane. When paired with a carry try not take CS from him/her especially if that person knows what they're doing (non-baddie). Check their jungle periodically if you happen to be bot as Dire or Top as Radiant, as well as your own jungle. Bloodlust will give your carry an advantage in lane and you should also use it to save yourself as well as your partner in lane seeing as it increases MS as well as AS. Later on you can Farm an entire lane by yourself as long as no carry is there to pick it up, spam  Ignites in lane to spawn  Multi Casts and farm creeps in lane. (Only do in later game when mana is no longer a huge issue) <br/>In the even that you are lane partners with someone who is not a carry such as Initiators. Feel free to grab CS, Ogre Magi has a great base damage early game which makes him quite good at last hitting. and since  Ogre Magi needs to obtain items like Arcane Boots Early CS is good if laned with someone who doesn't desperately need.","Roaming is an attribute that Ogre Magi really excels in. He has a stun, a slow and is a beefy hero in general. Obviously you are going to want a Bottle as soon as possible for maximum ganking potential. As long as you have mana and it's mid game and up Roaming is a very viable option. Even as support you should be making a good Gank effort. Dominate Runes and keep an eye on them as well since you should be warding regularly. The rest is fairly self explanatory, Open with Fireblast follow it up with Ignite and Bloodlust the carries.",Unrefined Fireblast this is a wave version of  Fireblast that does increased damage and stuns as well. This ability is only obtained by purchasing an Aghanim's Scepter which I do not personally recommend. It's an expensive item and I feel as if there are better options available.,dotafire,Leech,http://www.dotafire.com/dota-2/guide/double-or-nothing-714,80,1,2,1,3,1,4,1,3,3,3,4,2,2,2,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"Iron Branch, Iron Branch, Iron Branch, Animal Courier, Clarity, Clarity, Tango","Arcane Boots, Orb of Venom, Magic Wand","Aghanim's Scepter, Necronomicon, Orchid Malevolence, Rod of Atos, Scythe of Vyse, Shiva's Guard, Mekansm"
