As a ranged hero with the best range in the game, this shouldn’t be too hard. Just get the last hits / denies, and punish whoever comes forward. Pretty standard stuff, but the gold makes all the difference.", "This is where the build really starts to shine. If you’ve been getting all those last hits, you should easily have your morbid mask + crystallis. Combined with the ministun, you can not only heavily damage enemy heroes, but also take on enemy creep waves (and towers!) solo. Use this to your advantage; push hard and fast. It will be hard for an enemy hero to take you on solo, and in group battles you can sit back and killsteal as damaged heroes try and run away. Additionally, you should have plenty of mana, so use that assassinate to harrass!", "At this point, you should be near unstoppable. If you have the kills under your belt, you should easily be able to afford the Daedelus, and get part way to another item (I like the Eye, but Satanic is a great choice too). Soloing creep waves and towers is even easier now, and you can swoop in and kill any enemy hero stupid enough to go out alone. Like earlier, in team battles you get to clean up the stragglers with Assassinate. Easy mode.", "Super Sniper", "", "" , "Sniper", 1);
