Moving on, choose a lane partner who is preferably ranged and has a stun or a slow because this, along with your 3 first skills can give you a quick First Blood,  Crystal Maiden, Lion, and  Skywrath Mage are excellent examples. <br/> As soon as you are in the lane be sure to get a few last hits, at least if you are not fighting alongside a Hard Carrier for your team, if that's the case then leave it to him and focus a bit in denying. Preserve your mana for now, unless you are suffering a lot of harass, if that's the case then turn your  Aphotic Shield up and have no fear when approaching the creeps, the same applies to the case of having the Hard Carrier with you, if it goes like that then give him the shield whenever it's necessary and occasionally use your  Mist Coil to either heal your lane partner or harass the poor enemy hero who only has 600 of HP.", "So, you already have your  Phase Boots and  Drum of Endurance, oh wait! You don't? Your early game was a huge load of s***? Don't worry then, time to go farm. That's right, whenever you feel like the game is controlled and without any action going on go farm near your lane. The biggest mistake, which I see everyday, is that whenever there are enemy heroes near a tower everybody stops farming and starts walking around the tower, don't do it, so that Abaddon can get strong it needs to farm, pop your shield up and face those neutrals like a real man!", "If a teamfight is about to break down then you will need to study well how you are going to do it, and that requires a lot of comunnication with your teammates, remember that your  Curse of Avernus gives a steroid of Attack Speed to anyone who focus the same enemy that you are hitting, so it's extremely important to know who will go down first. The second important thing is to define who will start the mess, whoever it is must be granted  Aphotic Shield as it will absorb the initial damage and explode into everybody face at the same time. Don't be afraid to turn your ultimate manually if it's necessary, and if anyone tries to run away remember to activate those  Phase Boots and attack/slow the runner so that the rest of the team can help you finish it off.<br/> This is almost as how you will have to play during the whole match, there isn't a lot of secrecy, it's simple, but must be done right to get good results. If you see that an important hero of your team is going down then use Mist Coil to heal him and give him  Aphotic Shield next, as this might improve greatly the chances of the teamfight turning to your side.", "The Freezing Blade of Death", "dotafire", "LG_Fox_Brazil", "http://www.dotafire.com/dota-2/guide/the-freezing-blade-of-death-5330","Abaddon", "60");
