He can be a game changer, in a positive way, but also in a negative way!", "Well, Since Tuskarr needs some levels and farm in order to be really good, you'll want to farm your early game items as soon as possible. The best lane partners you can have are supports who can disable. For example Crystal Maiden, Lina and so on. You can get some easy kills with your Snowball if you got a good support that can stun or slow the enemy. Snowball both of you in, stun, hits, and  Ice Shards if he's still alive and getting away! If you can't handle your lane and you can't farm or get experience, you should roam and gank, in order to help the other lanes to dominate the enemies.", "Ganking as Tuskarr is simple. You'll have your  Bottle so you can pick up runes, which will give you a good heal and will fix your mana problems. You can initiate alone with Snowball, or you can just walk in the lane, grab your teammates and use Snowball together with them, so you'll roll together to the enemy hero. Then you can use  Ice Shards in order to block your enemy, since it creates a barrier in front of him. The Ice Shards isn't really necessary, only if the lane you're ganking has no disable or the enemy is escaping. When you're level 6, it'll be even easier! Since Walrus Punch is a strong spell which also stuns and slows the enemy. You can roam the lanes if you can't do something on your own lane, or if the other lanes are doing bad. Using the  Bottle to keep yourself with a good amount of health and mana, you'll gank pretty easily using your Snowball and  Ice Shards. If the river or jungle is warded and you can't gank, you can either purchase a  Smoke of Deceit, or just take the long way around the wards. Or if you're lucky, your support will talk English and he will actually de-ward.", "In team fights, if you initiated, you should focus on your enemies carry, since the carry deals the most damage. If the supports remain, you'll take them down easily when no one will kill you from behind. Remember,  Snowball in with your team and kill everything with your interesting spells! If the enemy team initiates on you, try to do your best to stop the hero that deals the most damage to your team. If everything goes wrong, just fall back and initiate when you can while your enemies are on cooldowns. Also, always use  Walrus Punch when the enemy is under 50% health, so it deals more damage.
