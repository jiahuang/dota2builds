A master at trapping and harassing this guide will focus on the 'Battle Furion' as it were.", "Remember: Because of your low damage output as well as your low health and very useless spells you will be a primary target early game. Make sure that you are very careful of all your moves early game and always watch out for ganks.<br/>One Melee: Harass him hard throughout early game. Never let a moment pass that you aren't making him feel uncomfortable being around. Deny and last hit as much stuff as you can.<br/>Two Melee: Harass your opponents as much as possible. However don't let your greed for last hits and denies get you killed. Watch for ganks.<br/>One Ranged: Regardless of what hero he is he will do more damage through his spells and his attacks than you will. Try to lure him close to the tower then Sprout him. Deny and last hit but watch for any aggressive moves from your opponent.<br/>Two Ranged: This will be a tumultuous experience. Be very careful and watch their characters closely for any aggressive moves. Deny and last hit as much as possible but be extremely careful.<br/>One Ranged One Melee: Harass the melee as much as you can while staying out of harms way. Keep your eye on their heroes for aggressive moves especially if either can stun. Deny and last hit as much as you can without jeopardizing your wellbeing.<br/>Your hero killing tactics will remain constant throughout the entire game. Stay in your lane and harass your opponent as much as you possibly can without jeopardizing your own life. When they are at low life and are attempting to run back to their base merely Sprout them. (Not a very hard strategy). Because of your low base damage make sure that your opponent is at low enough health that you can kill them", "Mid game is a time to focus on completing your Eye of Skadi and starting on your Seer's Mantel.<br/>In order to make money:<br/>1) Remember to use Wrath of Nature whenever it is up. As I mentioned earlier this will bring in about 200-300 gold. That is fantastic money for 300 mana!<br/>2) Use Force of Nature to push towers. You should have Force of Nature (Level 4) which means that you can get 5 Treants that do 21-24 damage. That means you have an extra 105 to 120 damage with you in your lane. Use this to your advantage Teleport to an undestroyed tower summon your Treants and take it down for the extra 400-500 gold.<br/>3) Don't die! You have several spells to keep you from dying-utilize them! First of all Sprout can keep your enemies away from you while you run like hell or it can protect you while you teleport out. Remember to teleport out after you kill a tower as well. Most likely your opponents will be pisT that you destroyed a tower and will come after your blood. Try not to let them have it, teleport out whenever you feel a situation is getting out of control.<br/>Now that you have reached a semi decent level the hero killing can begin in earnest. So we will now address hero killing with Teleport. Your spell Teleport can be used to save yourself as well as kill and enemy that is running away or destroying your ally. I like to teleport in behind my opponent so I can whack at them with my 56 damage as they run past me.<br/>Note: Teleport can be used in any place that you or your allies have already explored on the map. If you should see a guy go running off into the trees at 4 health it is usually justifiable to Teleport in the approximate area where you think he will be going through.", "Depending on how well you farmed as well as how many heroes you killed early game you have, in my opinion, two choices on how to play late game:<br/>1) Disable/Support- If you are a real team player and like seeing huge amounts of assists by your name start stocking up on items such as Guinsoo's Scythe of Vyse to allow you to trap/disable your opponent for the longest amount of time possible. Stick with other teammates and cruise around the map pushing lanes to the max with your Treants.<br/>2) Gank/Hero killer- Your teleport ability gives you the unique ability to sneak up on your enemy from across the map. Teleport far enough from your enemies that they cannot see you then run in Sprout them then bash them to death with your Eye of Skadi. In this build I tend to lean more toward a Buriza-do Kyanon because of the additional damage.<br/>Furion is one of the best backdoor'ers in the game.  Bckdooring is typically known as the practice of running far ahead of your creeps-usually into an opponents base-and destroying either towers or buildings.  Because of his teleport ability and Treant Summoning Furion is fantastic at backdooring.  Once you have explored up to their base feel free to pop in at any time summon some creeps from the trees on the side of their base and either destroy a tower or a barracks.  Afterward haul balls out either by teleporting if your cooldown is over or by merely running away.  Make sure you make a quick escape afterward because backdooring usually makes people rather angry.

For combating Furion and also playing him, map awareness is key.", "As a furion, going to jungle means that you will be farming for most of early-mid game, and ganking whenever possible with tp+sprout. But your main aim is to take down as many towers as soon as possible, with your tree army. Start out with 1 level in treants and buy a ring of basillus and a set of tangos. You should wait at fountain till the first day starts, and then summon treants at base. Once your mana is almost full (usually will fill while you are walking out of base) go to easy camp and start whacking the creeps there. The best level 1 camp for you is harpies, ghosts or ghouls. By the time you finish off first camp, your treants will be finished off with, so summon your next set and continue to next easy camp. Cycle between these 2 camps until you get level 2 treants (lv 3 on your hero) at which point you can continue doing the easy camps or go to mid level camp. My personal suggestion is to do easy camp till your treants are at lv 3, so that you have no problem in doing any camp on the map. If you get an ursa spawn in your easy camp, it will be a little difficult to farm, and even lower your exp/gold rate, but try to kill the ursas by alternating the tank between you and your treants (tango comes handy here).", "Sprout: This skill is pretty much what you will be using in every clash and skirmish you will be involved in as a Furion. It basically blocks your enemies in a bunch of trees for a duration of time. If your enemy hero is melee, there isn't much he can do to escape from the attacks from your team. Also, it gives flying vision over an area. It can be used to scout roshan and anti ward. It is also a good tool for creep blocking, but it's mostly better to save the mana and just manually block your creeps.<br/>Teleport: Teleport is a Furion player's biggest asset. With a 20 second cooldown at level 4, you are literally EVERYWHERE. You can push 3 lanes within a minute, go back to fountain whenever you are low on hp and/or mana, and it's best use is that you can teleport to gank anywhere on the map.", "Wrath of nature: At first this skill may seem very random, but it is actually very manipulable. Let's say you want to hit a hero at bot lane (he has 400 hp remaining and no magic resistance). Now you have 3 options<br/>a. Right click ulti on him, does 225 damage at level 3. [not going to get you the kill]<br/>b. Randomly ult on the map and hope he gets hit. [Can get you the kill]<br/>c. Click ulti on a creep wave at top/mid lane. [Will surely get you the kill]<br/>Your best bet is option c. that is, to ult at top, because it will go to bot after maximum bounces. You only need around ~7 bounces for the enemy to die, but by placing your ulti at top lane, you ensure that he will get hit with a +7 bounce'd ult since there will be atleast 7 creeps at top and mid both, not even counting the creeps at bot lane.
