Also be sure to use chakram for vision, such as of roshan or of the enemy barracks during a push.", "You’re not doing as much damage anymore, comparatively. your main role now is slowing down enemies for your allies, using chakram and whatever items you may have farmed (and keeping on them with timber chain to do it). the 15% base attribute reduction part of whirling death is by this point very effective at weakening carries.", "Timbersaw Guide", "dota2-utilities", "dota2-utilities", "http://www.dota2-utilities.com/guides/timbersaw-dota-2-hero-guide/1267/","Timbersaw", "60");
