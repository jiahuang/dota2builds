      VALUES ("Alchemist. Just by looking closely at his hero model, you can see that it's 2 goblins, and with that you can assume what all goblins love. GOLD :) This guide is directed towards a farming, hard-carry alchemist, forget the support/trilane alchemist because his potential is best used with expensive items. Although his ultimate gives him an edge in Attack speed, movement speed, HP and regeneration, his stats are fairly low per level. You want to get a side lane, possibly solo with a chen or enchantress in the jungle just in case you need help, or mid if the hero is not a hard physical hitter (nevermore, viper, sniper, drow, etc) These heroes might not do as well against you in the first few levels, but with their agility gain they will surpass your acid spray because it is considered as physical damage, therefore armor contributes towards damage reductions.", "Given the skill build, you can see that you will be using acid spray level 2 whenever possible, whislt making sure you stack up your passive to get more consecutive gold advantages. Seeing how your passive works, this only counts towards creeps that will give you gold, meaning denying is not ur utmost priority here. If you can deny a creep, go ahead. But, if there is a choice between a deny and a kill, go for the enemy creep. Acid spray level 3 and 4 will do the job of hurting ur enemy quite a bit, while making sure you can kill them for sure given the Quell blade as well as the armor reduction from acid spray. You ONLY want to last hit creeps, this should be a given for any hero who will CS, but there are exceptions (lane equilibrium). Your first item of choice should be a RoH, the HP regen will help out a LOT with your ultimate. Once you've acquired this item, get your support/lane partner to stack the creeps for you. Once he triple stacks the creep camp, he can pull it to deny a full wave of exp from the enemy. While the creeps are fighting each other, you can use an acid spray  right by your tower and just take every last hit from the creeps. After that you can use acid spray on the neutral jungle creeps and that will give you at least 5-8 times your passive stack for gold. You really don't need to worry about finishing vanguard first, having phase boots will be better given your ultimate will take care of the HP part. You WANT to stay in lane sitting and farming/ricing for the majority part of the game, up until you get all of your core items.", "So, had enough Csing? Not until you've gotten radiance you haven't! I like to stick to lane until you finish this item, double, triple, etc stack all the creep camps and you've got yourself a situational/luxury item as well. The reason why you want to do this is simply because radiance will bring at least 3 creep camps to you, and you can lay down acid spray to deal with them very fast while not wasting time going to each individual camp. After doing this, ancient stacking is what your looking for. During this point in the game, always carry a town portal. You still want to farm whenever possible without stopping, having a hefty amount of gold for buybacks and help out you team when possible. Roshan is always very good because Alchemist is hard enough to kill already, and having buyback gold means they have to kill you 3X to stop you from pushing. A lot of older alchemist builds have boots of travel and phase boots for mobility, but the current meta-game isn't about turtling anymore hence 2700 gold is a waste of money. Vanguard will start losing it's effectiveness after 120 damage per instance so getting assault cuirass is usually the best choice for a luxury item.", "By now, you should have realized how hard it is to kill alchemist, given you did your role correctly. Farm for buyback, kill roshan, push and refresh. Getting a BoT here is okay if you want to do split pushes, but not needed. you will want to ignore carries because alchemist just needs to cause chaos and take a lot of damage. There isn't much to be said here other than that every time you die there should be a reason for it. There is a limit to how much you can buy back and also the timer gets very long at the end of the game, waiting on 60-80 seconds can turn the game around easily and will often result in a loss or win. Main thing to think about when playing alchemist is csing and map awareness. You want to TP in for a kill or two when possible, or TP out if you smell a gank. He's a relatively easy hero to use in the right hands, but can be a huge letdown if you don't farm many items.", "Carry", "doat2-builds", "http://www.dota2-builds.com/view-dota2-build.php?id=301", "Alchemist", "1");

If farmed correctly, anti-mage can become the bane of all INT heroes.", "Because of its early squishiness, it’s recommended to play defensively, last hitting and denying the creeps, at least until you get yourself the Vanguard. Getting an item like Vanguard isn’t cheap, so try to get some of the gold back after getting it hitting the woods a little. You can also farm in the enemy woods since your blink will make for a quick escape if you are revealed, especially if you are smart and blink from the edge of the forest into the water, leaving the enemy in no position to chase you. The main key in early-game is farming. You are a very item dependent hero and you need that gold.", "After getting your early items, it’s not time to start working for the most important item in your build: Manta Style. This item is great on Anti-mage because the 2 images created also burn mana, rendering an enemy hero useless in an instant and offering you the opportunity to nuke him with your ultimate for full damage. The main question when building Manta is what item should I get first? Yasha or Ultimate Orb? This choice is very situational and you should judge from the standpoint of your game so far. For a more defensive approach, go with Ultimate Orb. If you farmed well and your team pretty much controls the game so far, go for a DPS item like Yasha.<br/>Besides farming, going into team battles is very important. Try to focus the mana dependent heroes because those will go down very easily when you use your mana on them since they have a lot of mana pool, thus giving you great damage. If they have junglers, scout them out, harass them and don’t let them build their setup. Your Blink is your friend, but don’t forget to manage your mana. Realizing that you don’t have enough mana for a Blink might bring your death.", "Late game is usually when Anti-mage shines, if you farmed all your necessary items.

While Axe can do just fine thinning out the numbers of endangered species in the jungle, it is generally preferable to pick a lane (and not the middle lane). Why? Axe is an early game hero and has a great last-hit animation. Axe can also royally own both squishy and melee heroes in the early stages of the game.

Though it is something that can only be taught with practice, you have to know when to use your Call. If you're facing only one enemy hero, there's no reason to Call unless you're guaranteed a kill. After all, Axe is slow: if you don't kill them with the Call, what's to keep the hero from running away? Also keep in mind that the Call doesn't come out instantly: Axe has to stop and then there's a slight delay before the spell goes off. Because of this, if you're chasing someone, do not Call until you are more or less right on top of them. Failing a Call makes you look stupid, and real men don't fail.", "In team fights, your job is to obviously do your best to maneuver into the middle of the action in order to Call and grab the attention of all the enemy heroes. To put it simply, unless you're depending on some massive initiator combo (such as with the allies I list below), this means Blink your ass in there and start some shit. Besides the fact that this is how you deal your damage, it also allows your allies to land their skills unmolested. And really, who wants to get molested? Unless you're carrying, your job is to simply soak up damage until your team kills everyone. Consider your death at the expense of the lives of several opponents to be a sign of a job well done. You died fighting like a man.<br/>This line of thinking also applies to pushing towers: as (more than likely) the most awesome and manly hero on your team, it's your job to lead the charge and tank the tower if need be. Just remember: the rest of your team is a bunch of pussies. Show them how it's done.", "The Bearded Menace ", "playdota", "http://www.playdota.com/guides/the-bearded-menace", "Axe", "50");

It draws you the necessary attention you'd need to trigger Counter Helix frequently and more reliably.<br/> Battle Hunger: This skill is used for either ganking, dagger disabling damage or cutting the enemy's support down to size. <br/>Counter Helix: Passive. This is not only Axe's most famous skill, it's this skill that makes Axe the famous manly hero he is (albeit because this makes him a masochistic red ballet dancer, but that's fine)<br/>Culling Blade:  If the pussy in question's HP is below the listed threshold, he or she dies instantly, regardless of buffs, magic immunity, Abaddon's ult, testicular fortitude, or standardized test scores. If the pussy has HP above the threshold, they instead receive a pitiful amount of damage, reduced by magic resistance and blocked by things like Linken's Sphere", "*Jungle: Now Axe's jungle is a bit unlike most of the other choke point melee junglers. You don't hope for fast jungling by heightening your DPS and conserving your HP, you do exactly the opposite. Stack those camps, as fast as you could. If you can, use the opportunity to double tank with Counter Helix (you aggro two different camps to attack you at the same time. If you can spare it, you can use Call to perma-aggro those creeps. Work even better if you already double/triple stack. However, saying that, you must know yourself how to do this, as I don't have the time nor the resources to make an effective mini guide on this (right now). You can always go for a side lane gank if you want, or even mid lane (If you're jungling Scourge's) with a well-time Battle Hunger and a surprise Call from the fog.<br/>*Solo: Not much you can do and not at all recommended. It's hard to harass decent player with Battle Hunger. Best you could do is to try and deny/last hit and hold creep equilibrium as best as you can. If you're facing a melee, it gets better, since you could aggro his creeps by attacking him, results in a very possible Helix trigger and make quick work of his attempt to last hit. However, the major problem is that this would push your lane VERY quick, and usually it's not what you'd want to do.<br/>*Team laning: This should be somewhat ok. Basically you can harass with Hunger properly because you have ranged (should be, or else you'd be better off in the jungle) teammates able to properly harass and be aggressive, keeping your opponents off the creep lane, and effectively forcing them to be aggressive or would completely lose the lane to you. If you drove them off, backdoor the lane and push it. Be sure to be somewhat aware of their ranged harass, or you'd drop fast against consecutive nuking this early in the game.", "Early game should be over in a flash (at leat that's how it seems to me nowadays). If you come out on top (somehow) with your core (preferbly Upgraded Boots + small early game item + wand + tp ready in 10 mins) then you're good to go. If you're going tanking, farm for a while in the jungle, because you can do it fast enough to keep up even with free farming hard carriers. However, it's advisable that you do not hinder your own opportunity and ability for too long, because as said many times before, it wains with time. After you have Blink (if you don't have Battle hunger) or even before if you had Hunger, try ganking non-stop (if you can of course). I shouldn't have to tell you how to farm though, that you need to know by heart already. <br/>When you gank, always try to open up with Hunger if you can, because with its ridiculously long range and DoT slowing effect, it helps alot (as the nature of all DoT), especially against Item-Blinkers. Then if you can, use whatever you can to close in on the distance (preferbly an allied disable, or a Blink if you have it) then Call. 3,5 seconds should let your helix and Hunger (urn aggressive active as well if you had it) deal alot of Helix. You should be able to finish with a Cull now (note to always see your opponent's hp first, and watch out for Wand burst). If not, yeah, Hunger again. A hunger deals more damage than a *supposed* Culling Blade anyways, heck you can even use Culling just to lower enemy's health (though it sucks at the use, it's better than nothing)", "As the initiator (not always the main), jump in with blink. If you have a main initiator, and if you even had a choice, jump in on the caster-support (preferly more than 1, but things aren't always easy) instead of the fed dps carry (this should be obvious). You would take almost neglible damage from the forced attacks of Call, while your disablers can jump on those god damn dps carriers. However, since Call is one of the few (if not only, I'm checking) non-ultimate disables that go through BKB, if it's needed to keep their dps carry occupied, do it. Then, Hunger the opponent who's least likely to be able to kill anything, urn the appropriate target and culling when you have a chance. Remember, most of Axe's skills go through BKB, so always keep priority in mind. Unfortunately, you can't do too much in team fights, since people wouldn't focus you anyways. You are quite easy to kite, but it gets better with Hunger being a pain in the ass up until late game.<br/>This is when you'll probably want that Blademail ready. You have to take out as many supports as fast as possible, or to take out that annoying dps carry of the opponent within a Callling Culling time (call and be able to successfully be able to use cull duringt he duration of the disable). Of course, if the carry you're targetting obviously has a good buy out, then you might want to reconsider, unless you have Aghnim's Scepter. Your helix and hunger doesn't hurt as much anymore, if at all. 30 armor doesn't compeltely nullifies physical dps anymore, while having the opponent under ulti's threshold gets even more rarely seen. Congratulations, you've just reached a phase that you should've have been in. However, things don't always go as planned, so try your best to pull throughs the late game with well-time initiation and good DoT placement.

      VALUES ("Atropos the Bane Elemental is a disabler, whose role in team is centralized on ganking and supporting. Although being a powerful hero, he is unfortunately not very popular in neither public, nor competitive games. I'm not a competitive player myself, but I think there are three main reasons why Bane is seldom picked on tournaments: Firstly, bane sucks terrebly at pushing. No AOE skill, no physical damage output - nothing that will help clear a creepwave. Secondly, Radiance, a very popular item in competitive play, doesn't combine well with Nightmare. Finally, Atropos isn't very usefull in teamfights as all of his spells are single-target and ult tends to get interrupted fast when there are a lot of enemies around.", "Bane is a strong laner, thanks to his Brain Sap and Nightmare. Whatever happens, you can quickly put your opponent to sleep or heal yourself by brainsapping someone. Manage your mana carefully. Your starting INT and INT growth are rather low, while your spells cost a lot of mp to cast. Bane can go solo or dual lane, but solo is of course more preferable. <br/>Solo mid: Your best option if you are playing alone in a pub. Being a ganker, Bane is a very nice candidate for solomid, coz once he reaches level 6, enemy sidelaners are gonna be around lvl4, and Bane can just gank the shit out of them. So farm-farm-farm until you hit level 6. Now it's Gank time! Go gank someone, return back to mid and farm, then gank again 100 seconds later (Fiend's Grip cd) and keep the cycle running for the next few minutes until the laning stage of the game ends.<br/>Solo short (easy) lane. This is your best bet if you are playing with a friend, if he is willing to take a jungling hero like Lycan or Naix. Once you hit level 6 (jungler being usually ~lvl5 at this point) you can easily kill 1 enemy, and often 2. Just call the jungler in for a gank on your lane, Nightmare one, take down via Ulti the other (often you can even do it alone). Remember to leave the lasthit to your carry if possible.<br/>Dual lane. The least preferable scenerio, but still tolerable. If you go dual, remember that Atropos is a support hero, and thus you should focus on denying rather then lasthitting creeps, as your lane partner is likely to need gold more than you do. Try to harass enemy heroes, though Atropos' attack range is only 400, he still can do that if there are melee heroes laning against him.", "Bane is a very strong ganker from level 6 thanks to Fiend's Grip, but he often requires a partner. Baisically, 2vs1 or 2vs2 you should always get a kill.If you are ganking one person, simply cast Fiend's Grip on him and watch him go down while your ult and your partner eat his health. And I strongly recommend you taking someone with you, because Fiend's Grip+Brain Sap combination of course does deal a lot of damage, but most heroes can withstand that. Ganking 2on2 is similar, only you have to Nightmare someone first. Then you can take down the Fiend's Gripped one, and after that, if you still have the ability, deal with the one that woke up after Nightmare.<br/>5 steps to a successful gank: <br/>1. Check cooldown. Fiends Grip is your main ganking tool. If it's on cooldown you can't gank anyone, obviously. If it's not, you should gank someone. A few successful ganks can be game-breaking. To reach the maximum efficiency, you should in theory gank every 100 seconds starting the moment you've got level 6.<br/>2. Chose a target. Preferably a carry, but any hero thats not tower-hugging would do really.<br/>3. Check mana. A really simple yet important step. You don't wanna sleep someone, summon neco-dudes and find out that you don't have mana for Fiends Grip.<br/>4. Notify your teammates. ", "Unfortunately, large teamfights isn't Bane's strong side either. Not until he collected all the right items. Small teamfights (like 3 on 3) is another pair of shoes though, but I'm not sure that it's correct to actually call a '3on3 fight' a 'teamfight' (it is often reffered to as 'skirmish'). Anyway, prior to using your devastating ult in a teamfight, you should try to use all your items and abilities. Usually you would start by Enfeebling someone, as this spell has the longest range. Then you should put somebody to sleep (someone who can potentially interrupt your ult), use items like Eul's and Guinsoo, then, just before casting your ult, summon Necro-dudes and activate BKB (or activate Lotar right after casting FG). This is the case when things go well, Bane has most of the items he needs, he doesn't get focused and taken down quickly and has the time to do all his stuff. In reality, Bane is a big target in teamfight's and often gets raped pretty fast. Even if you survive to do your stuff and start casting your ult, you are very likely to get interrupted, coz when Bane starts Fiend's Gripping, he becomes target number one. And every single bitch in the opponent team will try to end your ult as fast as he can.", "Be your enemy's worst nightmare", "playdota", "http://www.playdota.com/guides/be-your-enemys-worst-nightmare", "Bane", "60");

The fact that Atropos is ranged and has Brain Sap to create a 600hp gap in life allows for relativly easy laning. His ultimate is the best single target disable in the game but has a drawback; Fiend's Grip is a channeling spell. Atropos is item independant and can easily adapt to whatever the team needs. All in all Atropos is a strong pick no matter where you play.", "Get your starting items and walk towards any lane. I recommend going top for sentinel, bottom for scourge or head for the middle lane, since these lanes are not as safe as the last lane and you have no trouble keeping your health up with Brain Sap. Atropos can hold a solo lane without any real trouble as well. If you do get in trouble on your lane, ask your team to come for a gank, switch lanes with someone or get a lane partner. Block the creeps as much as possible if you got the top or bottom lane so the creep waves collide a bit closer to your tower. If you went mid, block the creeps, but not to much. You want to keep the high ground advantage to compensate for your low range but you don't want to let the tower get the creeps and push your lane. Harass the enemy with your normal attack as it does decent damage, and keep Brain Sap for healing yourself or finishing the enemy. If you are laning against low hp heroes and you are level 6, Fiend's Grip will take A LOT if not all of their hp, allowing you to finish them off with Brain Sap. If you know you can't get the kill with Fiend's Grip, save it untill you are sure you can get the kill. You should get out of your lane with a fair amount of gold and a couple of kills.", "You should wait untill level 6 or 7 before you start ganking. However, if you are on the middle lane and happen to get a rune, go gank the side lanes. When you hit level 6 you can really start ganking. Fiend's Grip pretty much ensures a kill. Open with Nightmare. If it's a solo target this ensures everyone can get in position. If he has a team mate with him, Nightmare the one that might screw up your gank. In an ideal situation someone will wake up the lone target with another disable, allowing you and your allies to quickly finish him off. If he had a partner, disable him right after you've Nightmared the first enemy and try to kill him before his partner wakes up. If he manages to get to safety before you and your allies can disable him, simply focus on the Nightmared target instead.", "Start off by enfeebling their biggest DPS threat you are not going to use Fiend's Grip on. Enfeeble has the longest range of all your spells, so this should be the first thing you do. After that Nightmare/Hex someone you don't want to deal with. This could be a disabler, healer or something with a scary ultimate. After that's done, summon the minions from your Necronomicon and use your Black King Bar if you have those, and grip the target that you and your team will take down first. Order the minions from your Necronomicon to attack the gripped target and don't forget to mana burn someone. When the gripped target is dead, order the minions to attack something else and try to stay alive. If you used Brain Sap already all of your skills are cooling down and you don't have anything to contribute other than your physical attack. If you didn't use Brain Sap already use it to stay alive.

If the enemy mid laner is melee then you really shouldn't have any problems keeping him down, spam your Sticky Napalm on him, if he stands in it for 5 stacks and refuses to go back, go for the kill, if he does go back, use that time to get some lasthits. If the enemy mid laner is ranged, you might have some issues, try to keep your distance (most heroes will have bigger range than you) and spam your  Sticky Napalm on them, it has a very big casting range. Same rules apply as if he was a melee hero from there on. You can start your spamming even from level 1 preparing them for your Firefly once you reach level 2. Some of them might get a  Magic Stick to 'counter' you a bit, this might work if the lane is pushed towards their tower, however if they manage to push the creeps to your tower and they got a bunch of stacks on them, a Magic Stick just won't save them, the slow from  Sticky Napalm will be unbearable and you will have plenty of damage. If you manage to push the creeps a bit closer to his tower, don't hesitate to scout for runes and maybe get that early first blood with a haste rune. Focus lasthitting rather than denying,  Batrider needs at least a Boots of Speed to be effective in his ganks. At level 6 your laning phase officially ends and you are now a constant roamer, you should have a Boots of Speed and a Town Portal Scroll at least, waiting for you home. Focus on finishing your Power Treads first instead of getting early Bracers, speed is more important for a ganker.", "Once you got home, get whatever items you could afford + that Town Portal Scroll, tp on one of your allied lanes (use second tower if the lane is too pushed, so the enemy won't see you coming) that is a bit pushed and proceed to get your first kill (if you didn't get a first blood already). Start your Firefly and get in a good position (since you can fly over anything), then just simply cast Sticky Napalm on your targets until you reach your main target, cast flamming lasso on it a drag it back towards your teammates so you can finish the job faster. It's kind of impossible to avoid Batrider's ganks unless they towerhug, and even then, Batrider is a good tower diver. If your allies happen to have stuns and are capable of taking 1 enemy laner alone, maybe you can focus on the one they can't take out instead. Once that is done, you should be able to get your Belt of Strength and have another Town Portal Scroll waiting for you home. You could farm a bit while your ultimate is in cooldown, but once it's up or nearly up it's time to get moving. Focus item-dependant heroes in your ganks, especially carries. Try to help with the pushing after a gank if your lanemates are capable. Keep ganking until the laning phase is officially done for everyone. Don't ignore runes!! By the end of midgame you should have your Power Treads,2-3 Bracers, Magic Wand and a part of your next big item, or a bunch of gold.", "If your team is average and you did a good job in the early stages, there really shouldn't be any late-game to speak about. If things drag this long it's either because you have some kinda of hard carry in your team that just can't do much early-mid game or you are kinda on the loosing side. If you are however, doing fine and everything is under control, focus on finishing your first big item and working towards your second. If you opt for mobility with Blink Dagger and Force Staff you will end up as your team's initiator, pick your targets carefully. If you opt for tankage, then either wait for their initiator to initiate or yours, then just spam your Sticky Napalm and spread Firefly across the the battlefield, disable the enemy carry with Flaming Lasso and drop a Flamebreak from time to time. Don't forget to autoattack as well since your attacks also get amplified by Sticky Napalm If you win the teambattle then push if you are able to, otherwise look for a rune (maybe you get a lucky regeneration) or go heal.

      VALUES ("Rexxar is a Support hero. His role as a support is to roam and gank to help your carry land kills. He is item independent the first half of the match, give him a Bottle and Boots of Speed and he's ready to gank all through mid game. To aid his team, he relies on Call of the Wild. Built in the bundle, come a stealthy Hawk and a wild Pig that makes nasty sounds all game. This gives you the ability to scout effectively and help your teammates with an extra slow. Rexxar is also one of the innate Necronomicon users. His synergy with this damn book is just amazing. No matter if the enemy can run fast or goes invisible, the Necro-dudes coupled with your pig, are there to stop them.<br/>The only major drawback of Beast Master, is that his skills and stats don't scale into Late Game as well as other heroes' do. Your Wild Axes get a lot weaker late game when enemies have lots of armor and your summons become more fragile and easier to kill. However, this is not something that's unfix-able. To remedy this, he needs late game items (I'm talking about later than Necronomicon Level 3) in order to transform his role into something more useful than a ganker, I call that 'Modifying' his role. So it's easier to understand, this will mean stop using Bottle, warding less and taking other responsibilities based on your team's needs.", "First skill as mentioned before, should be Wild Axes. It can be very useful at the very start of the game and may land you a very early First Blood if you have a good partner. As soon as you reach level 3, learn level 2 of Call of the Wild and cast it.<br/>From here, until the end of the game, you should always have a pig with you. Lots of players cast Call of the Wild only when they're about to engage in combat, not only that but they will forget about the hawk and often times even the pig (after the fight).<br/>Group yourself with your pig and send the hawk to the rune spot. Don't forget that Scout Hawk is not invisible and he is VERY fragile. Be careful when and where you cast Call of the Wild. Most of the time, smart, ranged players will kill your hawk instantly after casting if you cast it close enough. Remember that Runes spawn every 2 minutes. Have your hawk watching the rune spot.<br/>If your enemies are melee, try to constantly attack them with your pig and with your own attack if possible. This might end up giving you a First Blood if your wave kills the enemy wave and the enemy hero is still slowed by your pig. If enemy is long-ranged or has an annoying nuke, use your Wild Axes but don't abuse your mana pool, you will need 270 Mana for your combo once you reach Level 6.", "Your item build at this point should consist of Bottle, Boots of Speed and a Bracer or two. Tend to always have a Scroll of Town Portal if possible and always fill your backpack with GG Branches. Start thinking about upgrading a Bracer into Janngo of Endurance. Keep ganking and staying in sync with your team. Note your weakness and start thinking on what extension item you need the most. <br/>Most of the time you'll end up getting Necronomicon, now you have more than enough strength to pack a punch. There's something to understand about Necronomicon- It's purpose is to deplete your enemy's mana pool, thus preventing any means of escape or counter-attack. When ganking, always position your hawk around a reasonable way of escape for the enemy hero which could in effect be a way for their allies to counter-attack. <br/>Blink in behind enemy and start with Primal Roar, and order yourself and the pig to attack the hero. At level 1, Primal Roar will give you 3 seconds to attack the hero, that's not as good as a level 3 Primal Roar but it's still plenty of time to get some hits down from you and the pig or any other allies. Use Wild Axes as soon as you get near them to start attacking. Use Wild Axes as often as possible, and remember to cancel your pig's animation when you're chasing with it.", "Your core and have extension items, you're pretty much set until the game ends. At this point of the game, Primal Roar will be the best use of you for your team. Combined with Necronomicon it will wreck enemies. And by wrecking, I mean wrecking. In a 1-on-1 situation, the power of your combo once you have maxed Primal Roar and Necronomicon is in-par with that of Bane Elemental's. You will literally destroy any INT hero or severely cripple tanks and carries.<br/>Late Game is when you'll most likely be team-fighting and pushing (I call this unwillingly farming for your extension items). By this time you should have optionally upgraded to Boots of Travel to enhance map control and ease of pushing. Janggo can be an awesome late game item when the smallest advantage in speed can give you the edge in fights. Start buying extension items such as Plate Mail or Point Booster based on the heroes you're facing and the role your team needs. Feel free to sell Bottle for other more expensive ingredients, your mana pool will be big enough so that you don't need any extra regen at this point. Until then pay attention to Runes as always, and be alert with minimap. Necrobook Level 3 will get rid of problems with invisible heroes in battles and/or ganks late game.

It really depends on what your team needs. If your team lacks a good disabler, becoming a semi-caster/tank is a very viable option, however if your team really lacks some sort of a carry type hero, we can do that just as well.", "Rune Control. It is a very vital part of early game. Since we are melee... and not exactly a harasser you should try and go for the side lanes. You don't have to solo, going with a partner is actually nice since you can land some easy kills early game. Try to go with the int nukers since you can be their meat shield while they destroy everything. BE AGGRESSIVE! I know you can be a decent late game hero, but early game you are a very decent threat to your opponents.  Many people get carried away, when they are higher leveled and have more HP, so they think they can pick on the panda. Let's see one unlucky cow that tried it. Mana management is a crucial part of a good Panda player. Since our mana pool is so limited, we need to use every last drop of our mana available.

If your team has a horrible mid game, chances are your late game isn't going to get better. Also due to the fact that Panda isn't exactly a h@xz00r late gamer, we need this mid game to be successful. In order for this to happen, we need to perfect using our ulti. Thus good good chunk of this Mid Game is based on how to use our awesome ultimate. There is a general misconception with Panda's ulti. Most people only use it for escape and rarely use it for any other purpose. This is probably because they don't really get a chance to use all of Panda's skill to it's maximum potential, with the short time period allowed. That is what I will try and do for you here today, to educate you on using your ulti for, killing, chasing, tanking, supporting, disabling, and escaping. <br/>Now I know it's not always possible to tell which way you are facing and such, but this is still very useful. For example, when you are chasing someone down the river you are moving South East and thus Storm will be highlighted first. Now, if you knew this information you can  simply press 'c' and cyclone the guy, however if you didn't then you would have to look and maybe, if you panic, even tab a few times before you get the right key going. Knowing which panda will be highlighted first can save you precious seconds, that the animation of your ulti wasted. ", "Always remember, our mid game was spectacular,  'our' late game is just as good. However we are not built to be the insane late game carry hero. That is why at this point, try and end the game earlier by killing, pushing, and then some more killing, pushing.<br/> AFTER you have split there is a definite procedure you should follow to escape successfully and deal damage back at the same time. The key concept here is actually just repeating the obvious, make ONLY your earth panda run. Leave the other two to duke it out with your opponents.<br/>At this stage of the game, mana should not be too much of a concern. When are are about level 15ish, remember that Blink Dagger Costs Mana. You have to add that to your combo. Or else you might end up blinking in, clap and have no mana left for your ulti. Other than that, mana is less strict as of now.

      VALUES ("Before we begin, lets take a look at Panda.  Panda has a stat gain of 6.1 per level.  This is slightly below average [average stat gain = 6.2].  His pathetic int gain of 1.25 is going to cause some mana problems, and it may be wise to invest in some nulls, especially when Thunder clap costs 150 mana and when you get your blink dagger, you will have around 400 mana--enough for a clap, blink, clap and nothing else. [although that probably will kill the unfortunate hero ^^]  His Str gain is 2.9--an above average gain, even for a Str hero, and Panda ranks among those with the highest Str gains.", "Pretty much, the success of Panda in this game is based on how well you are able to stay in your lane early game.  Solo bottom sentinel or top scourge is preferable, but its all up to preference.  If you have confidence in your last hit/deny skills, call a solo.<br/>You should leave shop with nothing in your inventory. Although it is possible to wait for the ring of regeneration, you will probably miss the chance to creep block then.<br/> Some regen and the chicken should help you greatly.  Have your chicken bring you components and potions regularly, even if you don't need them at the moment.  Staying stocked with potions helps you to not miss out on any experience.  If done well, and your allies call missing, you should be able to stay in your lane long enough for the blink dagger.", "You should have your Treads and the blink dagger by now, because its time to kill stuff.  The full combo takes 390 mana, so make sure you have enough. Usually Panda has just enough at that phase of the game.  If you find a potential gank victim, approach from behind and give him a thunder clap.  Whack away, and if he runs, stop attacking him, and run alongside until Clap cools down--it shouldn't be too long [Clap cd= 10 seconds].  When clap is ready, blink in front of them, blocking their path, and mash C until clap activates.  Slap them silly until they die.<br/>Most people will just click the dagger, then click an area at the other side of the screen.  Sure, this will work, but the 'Pro' way to blink is called the blink-stop.  This involves blinking directly in front of the running enemy, stopping their movement completely for a precious second.  This ensures that you won't miss your clap and get a few more hits in.<br/>At level 9 you should acquire Primal Split.  This is a very multipurpose skill--it is used mostly for escaping, but with some good micro skills you can use it to attack as well.  Note that the Pandas deal piercing damage, which is halved on heroes.  Piercing damage deals 1/4 to a tower or structure.  However, you won't be able to use Primal Split offensively until later in the game, when you have enough mana to support it.  Earlier, it is better to just blink away.  Later, you can split, then leave the fire and earth pandas to distract/block the enemies, and wind walk the air panda out to safety.", "Late game is phenominal for Panda.  With skadi, his HP jumps to about 3000, and he has enough mana to spam Clap recklessly.  The slow is the most useful feature however, as you can chase heroes better than ever before.<br/>At this point, there is no use trying to face Panda 1v1.  If there is some arrogant troll warlord or something that has the misfortune of thinking he can beat you, then be aggressive.  Use drunken haze to make the enemy miss a GREAT amount of his attacks, stopping permabashers.  The slow from skadi and the 55% attack speed slow from stomp will keep them at bay, and to top it off you get frequent criticals and evade a fourth of all attacks.  If they do try to escape, the skadi frost and blink-stop combo will make sure they die.<br/>Primal Split is very good to use in massive team battles.  In a great battle, you probably wont be able to tell what is going on.  Primal Split breaks up these battles like no other.  You can split, cyclone an important enemy, hurl a boulder at another, and whack away at the weakest enemy.  By breaking up the ranks like this, your team should be able to tear them apart.  If you feel that you might die, use wind walk on the air panda and glide out.", "Bring the Pandamonium", "dotastrategy", "http://www.dotastrategy.com/strategy-3136-BringthePandamonium.html#earlygame", "Brewmaster", "80");

Heavily reliant on lurking in Webs in early game; if you aren't in mid, you might be forced either to spend more points on Web than you want or towerhug until the creeps fight in your web again. Farming and/or pushing efforts easily countered by enemy AOE spells. Somewhat average agility gain of 2.2 rather than full-fledged agility gain. ", "Attempt to go mid lane, because it is best for your lane control strategy. If you can't go mid then it doesn't matter whether you are top or bottom lane but either one you will need two levels of Web instead of one and that means no Bite until lvl8, and we can't have that. Hence go mid.<br/> Ideally you want your Webs in spots that allow you to do all of the following from the safety of the Web: Last-hit/Deny creeps, Harass/Kill enemy heroes, Gain experience. Also, do not put the Webs directly adjacent to each other. Some people think that you need to do this, but you don't. The Web buff (the movespeed, invisibility, and regeneration) lasts a few seconds after you leave the boundaries of the Web. What you need to do is this; after placing your first Web, unless you already know how far apart you need it from experience, find out the distance yourself by running out from the Web until you lose the Web buff. Then place a second Web over the area you were in immediately before you lost the buff. Now you should be able to traverse the two Webs without losing the buff. Later on, this pre-determined distance will become larger since you have Boots and then Treads, and you can get farther before the buff dissipates. Place later Webs accordingly.", "Lane killing: Exactly the same procedure as in early game: go behind them, I-Win Button on, disembowel the target, Spiderling the target. If theres two of them, mow down one, then mow the other and finish them with the Spiderlings. Allies to help if and when necessary. You should still avoid certain disablers in such attacks (Rhasta, Lion, etc). If you by any chance have a Black King Bar, said disablers are your easiest targets and should be murdered at all times.<br/>Ganking: The sole difference is that you'll have to put in a tiny bit more effort due to your lack of Webs in this area - come from way behind them in their lane or from fog, and turn on Insatiable Hunger once you're right on top of them and they can't run anywhere. If you have an ally or two around, they disable or attack the target now, rest is the same as before.<br/>Team Battles: Now, if you went in first you would become a target for who-knows how many disables. So don't do that. What you should do is wait until your team has engaged - if possible, via a powerful ganking skill such as Netherswap or Meat Hook - then pick out either the weakest (and first to die) on their side, or the one who's doing your side the most damage, or whoever your side decided was the prime target prior to the fight. Then hit the I-Win Button and charge them. Attack them until they are red-zoned and finish them with Spiderlings - no risks, just throw in everything you've got rather than reserve an average nuke with a 10 second cooldown. Then attack someone else. Keep going, until Hunger wears off. At this point, if they have more disables and nukes left than your side, head for that Web. If your side is on top, press the attack. You should have Spiderlings again by now, don't be afraid to use them.", "During late game, there isn't really much to add. Kill everything in sight, destroy the barracks, raze the Throne/Tree. All of the mid-game goals still apply in late game. Act exactly the same. Except possibly take on more heroes than before because you've farmed and been fed more. Late game for Spider is essentially an extension of mid game, or vice versa considering that it has more late game activities.", "I-Win Button", "dotastrategy", "http://www.dotastrategy.com/strategy-8895-IWinButtonShimrra3sguidetoBroodmother.html#earlygame", "Broodmother", "60");

The problem with Chen is, people don't dare to try him and miss a great hero concept due to their decision.

Waiting for the right situation, run up to your enemy and use the right abilities at the right time. The difference is, your abilities are spread over many units.You should always try to engage your enemy when he does not expect it and to trap him between you and your allies. The best targets for your ganks are of course low HP heroes without escaping skills like Blink or Invisibility. Start with Penitence and attack. If your creep got a disable, try to get it close to the enemy (unless it's a Troll) and time the stun/ slow/ snare with your allies' disables. Try to chain as much stuns and slows as possible and keep on attacking with all your units. Don't be afraid of tower diving, a dying creep is not the end of the world.

Always stay near your teammates to heal them with Mekansm if necessary. Use Hand of God as early as possible if you have Aghanim's.

      VALUES ("Chen’s potential as a hero-killer has been overlooked by many. He’s an underestimated hero - something you can use to your advantage. According to me a hybrid battle-support Chen is the best way to go. Most people play Chen as a pure support hero - this causes him to become a soft target in battles. During ganks, he has hardly anything to contribute apart from his slow when played as a support; once dead, his valuable heal - a deciding factor - is removed. Remember, microing is an integral part of Chen’s gameplay; if you’re not too good at microing, you might want to practice against AI opponents until you get used to it. In this guide, I hope to teach you how I play Chen and to overcome all the above-said obstacles - have fun reading!", "Jungle: Probably the most important section out of the whole guide. Jungling is essential if you want to be a good Chen player. Jungling is advantageous to your team, too, becuase it can give an extra hero a solo lane. But Chen shouldn't only jungle. A good Chen will coordinate with his team mates and frequently pop out of the forest for ganks. To start with, head to a strong creep camp, such as Furbolgs or Centaurs. Dominate the strongest creep in that camp and kill the rest of the units in the camp, optionally using the creep's skill to quickly clear out the camp so that it recieves as little damage as possible. Once that creep is done, move on to the weakest camp, and clear it out. Your creep should have about half its HP left, so move on to the strongest camp again. In this camp, begin to attack the weaker units first, allowing your unit to tank the damage. Once your unit dies, Persuade the strongest creep in that camp, and repeat the cycle.<br/>Ganking: Usually, begin the gank by coming from behind the enemy so that he has nowhere to run, and it gives more time to position your creeps. Centaur Khan->hoof stomp, Ursa Warrior-> Thunder Clap, Dark Troll Warlord-> Ensnare", "Jungling: In middle game, you should try to jungle as much as possible, but should never give up an opportunity to gank an enemy. Constant ganking is essential if your team is to win, so you might have to ease up on jungling a little. Also, pushing becomes important, so jungling will have to take a back seat.<br/>Ganking: Ganking now shouldn't be much different than in early game. Just follow the 3 easy steps. However, several things also differ now: 1. You will have more creeps to control, meaning you need to know how to micro properly. 2. Both allies and enemies are getting stronger, meaning carries will begin to show their potential. 3. If you are dominating the game, enemies might start looking for you or focus firing you in ganks. After all, your Hand Of God is precious. <br/>As always, coordination with allies while ganking is a must. Time the use of both Mekansm and Hand Of God properly. Don't use them both in quick succession, unless you or your allies are very low on HP. ", "Pushing: Continue pushing as in mid game, but be more aware of you being the target of ganks. Be very map-aware, and wards can help a lot. Remember to Persuade the right creeps while pushing - a Ghost is pretty useless here. Use the abilities of your units effectively to clear out creep waves fast.<br/>Ganking: Ganking is very straightforward. As soon as you finish Guinsoo, use it as much as possible in your ganks. Always remember to use it on the pesky permabasher or a hero with a steroid spell (Eg: Barathrum) and finish them off before they can demolish your team. You can give up jungling all together, and roam the map to try and gank as much as possible. As before, remember to time the usage of Hand Of God and Mekansm properly. Notice, in the previous sequence, how I didn't use them simultaneously. If I did, Ursa would have killed me. Once you complete Guinsoo, there's not much more you need to farm for, so you can continue to supply your team with wards if you feel like. Aplha Wolves: The Alpha Wolf gives a great 30% increase damage Aura, which is extremely useful later on in the game, when heroes' damage get very high. Mortred, Juggernaut and the like, who are known for Criticals, will benefit a lot late game from this awesome aura. It's also useful in pushing and taking towers down fast.

Then you can sit back in the shadows and \'LOLOLOL FEEDERS!!!!\' to yourself while they rage and blame their team.

Your death will be less of a loss than an allies death and being at a low level means that you can often respawn in time to rejoin a team fight if it persists for long enough. <br/> If you are confident with your ability to survive, try to stay out of lane so that allies may gather XP and gold.  This will also allow you to surprise enemies during team fights.  You will get XP and gold as needed during successful team fights. <br/> Continue with general supporting roles.

This ability is useful in any situation, and due to its low cooldown period and mana cost it can be cast quite frequently. The Dark Seer's final spell, Wall of Replica, summons a shimmering barrier which duplicates any enemy hero that passes through it, creating an illusion of him.

The best carries to lane with are those who normally have a poor early game or can't farm well (Riki, Mortred, Spectre are pretty good examples). If you are with a strong lane controller (PotM, NA, Rhasta), you can probably take first blood very quickly. Another good option is to take a dual mid lane so you can control the river better.

Make sure to apply the same tactics as the dual lane but try to pick up as many last hits and denies as you can and do not auto-attack creeps as you have no carry to pick up last hits. Dazzle has a very nice attack animation and good damage so you should be able to pick up a decent amount of cash.", " Poison Touch gives you the ability to both save allies and stop enemies. However, it is very strenuous on your mana to spam it endlessly, so don't use it to harass. On a Weaved hero, it becomes a very dangerous nuke, generally dealing 200-300 damage, which can pick up kills on heroes with escape mechanisms.<br/>Shallow Grave is a difficult spell to place right. You do not want to waste any of its time to maximize its use, but it has a .5 second cast animation so you do not want to wait till the last second. In addition, don't be afraid to use it on yourself; it can allow you to get away from some very dangerous enemies that would normally be inescapable with only Poison Touch (Broodmother and Krobie come to mind pretty quickly). This will also prevent sudden death from a Necrolyte.<br/>Shadow Wave is Dazzle's bread and butter so it should be used whenever an ally gets into orange or below health. Try to use it on stunned heroes that are surrounded or on creep waves to pick up last hits. Make sure to spam Wave during Weave if people are tightly engaged in melee to deal ~200 per bounce. Also remember that Wave will target units even if they have lost sliver of health, so don't feel bad throwing a wave into the fray to put on some easy damage. It Dazzle's main damaging spell, so don't be afraid to spam it on nearly full health allies once you have some decent regen (Voidstone) or a slightly larger pool (1000+). You can easily nuke for 700 (5*140) damage before reduction, which is quite scary.<br/> Weave costs 100 mana, making it Dazzle's least expensive spell. Therefore, I encourage that people use it regularly on allies and enemies. If your team has a lot of physical DPS (Rexxar, Juggernaut), try to hit large groups of enemies boost DPS. If you are facing a large number of farmed carries who have mostly physical DPS, try to hit your entire team so you can shake off the damage while you Wave and Mek your allies back to full. It is always a good idea to open with Weave when you see a group of heroes before your initiator goes into the fray.", "You should be pretty mobile if you have Bottle or Mek and helping your team get kills and pushing out lanes. Make sure you get Wards and Salves to gain more control. If you find that your enemies have a very large amount of nukes and you are getting ganked and dying, get some Bracers or Magic Wand. By the time you hit 11, you really will need to pick up a Voidstone if you don't have an Orchid so you do not have to go back to base at all.<br/>If you are really making large amount of cash in the later part of the game (15+), Guinsoo's is your highest priority item because it will give you a disable. You should have gotten the Voidstone already if you aren't building Orchid, so slowly buy the other components while picking up wards/dust, consumables and scrolls. If you built Orchid by now, start on that Guinsoo's or Eul's if you can't make money.", "Brigning Physical DPS Back", "playdota", "http://www.playdota.com/guides/bringing-physical-dps-back", "Dazzle", "70");

Fortunately, by this point it's likely that you have  Mekansm and/or  Pipe of Insight so you still have plenty to do. Stay at a safe distance ( Shallow Grave now has a huge cast range) and concentrate on what's happening in the fight. Focus on your Carry, if they are anywhere near close to death... stick  Shallow Grave on them. Don't be tempted to wait until the last second. It's amazing how many times you get stunned when waiting for a last second Grave. Try to stay within range for a  Mekansm or  Pipe of Insight cast. The most important thing is to protect your carry but if it's safe, you should try and hit everyone. Save your  Poison Touch for potential channelling abilities or, if there's no danger of being  Black Hole'd, hit the enemy carry with it... especially if they're melee.

Krobelus can be ranked with the top heroes in this category, like the new Keeper Of The Light, due to her Ultimate which can counter a push just as efficiently as it is in making a push succesful, and her Carrion Swarm, as you have seen is also incredible at killing large waves of creeps, and hurting those fragile Intel and Agil heroes.

Ganking's importance sinks down in this section, and Pushing / Defending's importance is boosted.", "Staple's Guide to Krobelus", "dotastrategy", "http://www.dotastrategy.com/strategy-26196-StaplesGuideToKrobelusDeathProphet.html#earlygame", "Death Prophet", "60");

So to sum it up, here is what we do in massive team battles:<br/>1) When the initiators on your team have disabled the opposing team, go in.<br/>2) Turn on your ultimate.<br/>3) Silence the other team. Always try to silence their most dangerous spell caster/disabler.<br/>4) Spam Carrion Swarm/use Shivas if you have it.<br/>5) Use Silence again if necessary/chase fleeing heroes down with ultimate turned on.", "Late game our job is to go around the map pushing, stopping pushes, and fighting in team battles.

Since teams stick together at this point, it is also a good idea to stick with your team. Counter pushing is easy for us, 2 swarms take care of creep waves easily.

The fact that Witchcraft level 3 decreases the mana cost a fair amount, the starting items should be enough to keep you in lane.

Make sure you use your Silence if the enemy hero has a stun/disable in case of a gank. Once that tower is down, it's time to roam around and take down the other Tier 1 towers. <br/>So you've now pushed mid tower, their mid hero is kicked out of lane. What do you do now? Go and gank of course! With some great early burst damage and a fairly long silence, Death Prophet can be a competent ganker. Using your ult whenever it is off of cooldown, use it to push the remaining two Tier 1 towers. Once they are down, your team will be at a significant gold advantage, making you that much closer to your blood stone and giving the items that your team needs.", "I believe late game items builds are completely situational, but the most important part of playing Death Prophet is that you need to stay alive for your ult to do work.

      VALUES ("Sorry to disappoint you, but Luci is not a late game carry hero.  His base agi is 11 and the agi gain is 0.9 per level.  None of his skills give him attack speed either.  He is therefore not a late game dps hero and thus you should not build him as such.  Luci's other two attributes are much more impressive.  He has a high str gain and will have over 2500 hp when all is said and done.  His armor is somewhat low but that can be easily remmedied for cheap.  This means that he can function as a pseudo-tank if built right.  He also has 2 powerful nukes.  Also Scorched Earth is an excellent chasing skill.  But all of these skills lose effectiveness as the game wears on.  Therefore the best time for Luci to shine is mid-game and played as a caster/ganker.  He does have a decent int gain, but running around and casting lots of spells can be mana intensive, which is why int and mana regen items are very useful on Luci.  To repeat myself, Luci is primarily a caster/ganker and can function as a pseudo-tank with a few good defensive items.", "As discussed earlier, Doom can solo mid, but that should be left to better rune abusers and early game gankers.  He is much more at home at a side lane, where he can chase a bit if necessary.  This also gives him access to the side shops where he can buy important items like a Magic Stick or a Sobi Mask.  Additionally, enemy melee heroes tend to be on the side lanes rather than ranged heroes, making it easier for you to both farm and harass the enemy.<b/>Devour - You run up to a creep and click devour on it, that's it.  Since Devour has a long cd and relatively low mana cost, it is spammable.  This means that if the spell is off of cool down and you see a creep that you can eat, then eat it.  Try to be devouring something at all times.  This will help you gain both experience and gold faster than your opponents.", "Now that enemies are a higher level than 5 you can start to level up LVL Death so that it deals more damage.  If the enemies are lvl 8 you can consider holding off leveling it to 4 so that you can trigger the bonus damage on your opponents.  Scorched Earth is leveled up since it will increase the potential damage of your combo and will last longer and heal you for more.  Doom is taken when possible because it greatly increases the damage. <br/>Choosing a Target: The most important aspect of ganking is choosing good targets for ganking.  A Clinkz solo farming who can WW is much different that a Sniper solo farming.  Sure Doom can be used to stop Clinkz from using Windwalk, but you won't always have it available to use or be fast enough to cast it before the enemy sees you and reacts.  For these reasons it is much easier to gank heroes that do not have escape mechanisms.  You will also want to consider how much damage your combo can deal and whether or not it will be enough to kill the enemy hero.  A Kunkka has much more hp than a Sniper, so he would be harder to kill and would require more chasing and physical attacks to kill.  A third element is the location where the target hero is.  If they are farming on your side of the map (generally past the river), it is much easier to come from behind or the sides for a gank.  If they are on their side, you can still come from the side but from behind is generally not an option.  If you happen upon them while neutraling, this falls somewhere in between.  On one hand it is just you and the other hero, but you are in a heavily wooded area so there will be lots of trees to use to juke or otherwise escape your chasing.", "Ganking: Ganking in late game is similar to ganking in mid game.  However, your spell combo weakens because the enemy will have more hp and will have had the chance to farm counter items.  In this stage of the game it will be fairly hard to successfully solo gank an enemy hero.  Ganking with an ally is preferred and more effective.  During this stage of the game, enemy carry heroes will be the largest threat to you.  With Doom enemy int heroes still don't stand a chance, and even if you don't have Doom available you have enough hp to tank whatever spell harassment they have.  Enemy tanks will be able to absorb all of your spell damage, but they won't have that large of a damage output so you should be able to withstand that.  Enemy carry heroes are the ones who pose the largest threat to you.  If they survive your initial spell combo they can then out-dps you for a kill.  Be wary of this when you are choosing targets for ganking.<br/>Team Clashes: In the late game period, team clashes will be more prevalent than ganking.  With a second core item that allows you to tank better, your role in the clash is to be up front taking most of the aggro and disables.  The principles outlined in the mid game team clash section still apply and the ideal targets for each type of spell are still the same.

And at some moments, some heroes just can't help but refuse to level up, in fear of the almighty LVL? Death that causes them to eat extra damage. And who knows what extra abilities this dude has after Devour? A stun, a slow? Nobody knows, which adds all much more to the fear of facing him. And as the helpless fools attempt to run away, desperate to save their own lives, god speed is turned on with Scorched Earth, ensuring little chance for escape.", "As soon as you see the first creep, Devour it immediately. Try as much as possible not to get denied by your lane opponent (which should be reasonable as you have an insanely high base damage). The main reason behind this is because if your opponent gets even one deny, you won't be level 3 after the first 2 creep waves, when Devour has finished cooldown, and level 2 Devour gives 20 more gold, not to mention finishes faster. You might think this isn't much of a deal, but remember, every second that Devour could be used, it should be used. Level 2 Devour has a shorter cooldown, finishes faster, and gives more gold compared to level 1 Devour. You should be aiming to last hit as much as possible anyway, so try to achieve this state if you can.", "In my opinion, Doom's early game strategies end at level 7 (after all, there's no way to reset your skill points, so you will be stuck with level 4 LVL? Death for the rest of your game). After this, your only role is to, farm. It may be boring, but with it you can rush a Radiance under 20 minutes. After Radiance, immediately go for Scepter. If possible, try not to stop for Bracers, because they aren't really needed when you can rush for bigger items.", "So hopefully you have got your Scepter and Radiance. Now it's time to end the game.

For starting players or even mid-rank players (I consider myself one of those), however, I believe this guide can help quite a lot.", "Pick top lane sentinel, bottom lane scourge. Being close to the secret shop cuts a lot of precious travelling time. Lucifer can easily solo, even against two melee heroes. If its one ranged and one melee, he just might have some trouble, especially if they're nukers, if it's two ranged, best pick another lane or ask for a ranged partner.<br/>Get devour. Use devour on the ranged creep of the first wave, that should get you a few hits, but after that you can hang out in the back and restore with ring of regeneration while devouring the creep. Try getting a last hit or two, or a deny, those are helpful. When devour's over, devour another creep. Always try to make ranged creeps a priority for devour, since they have lower HP. Keep this up until lvl 5-6.<br/>Now then. If the hero is under 1000 hp, don't hesitate. Wait until he is in the lvl? death range, cast it on him, then doom. Try to get a few hits just to ensure killing him. Even in the scenario where he doesn't die, he's going back to base. Which is a good thing, even wasting your first doom for. Personally, since I hardly care about scores, I don't pursue hero killing too much at this stage, unless it's a low hp hero. You can get a lot of gold by farming, so why push it? Besides, sending heroes back to base and forth costs them more in time than actually killing them, up until lvl 6.", "You generally want to follow the same pattern as early game. You can amass tremendous gold by farming on an empty lane or lane with one hero-just keep harassing them with lvl? death if they are in the extra damage range. Move in for the kill if you feel certain, however, sending them back to base can also suffice (always, ALWAYS, those things depend on the level of your opponents. I just assume you are playing with others roughly the same skill as you).<br/>Farm, farm, farm. Devour on the ranged creep, then keep hitting the melee creeps, all of them at once with Battle fury. You don't need your creeps to kill of a wave of enemy creeps. Do it and get Boots of Travel and Heart of Tarrasque. This is easily achievable by level 16, if you follow the farming guidelines.<br/>If you have a stunner ally, call him in for a gang. If the enemy is ranged, that means he's bolder, so getting the kill is actually easier. Make sure your ally can attack from the sides or from behind, then go forward, if he's in the range, cast lvl? death, if he isn't just attack and retreat until he comes a bit forward to get a few 'free' hits. Then, your ally stuns, you attack, lvl? death regardless of his level, he tries to escape, doom! dead. If he's melee, just engage him (with your items and HP you should have no problem taking a few hits), spells and doom. Dead. If you and your ally have good timing, it's easy to do. Might actually work to cast doom in the beginning, if you're up against a spellcaster. This way, he will lose a lot of HP without retreating, since you'll have 'wasted' your ulti. If you can pack a bit of damage then, you and your ally can finish him off easily.", "95%, there will be no late game. If you don't drag it, you'll have so many kills and have pushed so badly that you should have won by now. However, if the enemy is persistent, your allies beginners (excuse me, but I don't really enjoy the term 'noob'), or you were holding back, it just might drag on a bit more.<br/>Like before, farming paradise. Just farm. Creeps will die in seconds. Buy Aghanim's by level 20, then go for Radiance, or the other way around, however you feel like. Radiance offers more damage and more farm (you won't need more farming capabilities though), while Aghanim's improves doom. It all depends on your observations-if you have needed to rely on doom to take kills, go for Aghanim's, if doom is just a luxury/silencer (which usually is true for me), go for Radiance. Also, against invisible/illusion-conjuring heroes, Radiance is quite useful, though battle fury partly replaces its role.<br/>For killing, just follow the same pattern as in mid-game, with the difference that you can easily solo an enemy now, even a strenght one. You are also capable of killing two intelligence or agility heroes at once, depending on the situation.<br/>In most cases, I don't care about the enemy heroes right now. I just keep pushing, it's way faster. You can either abandon your allies and go for a solo push. Your enemies will gang them. Be they successful or not, you'll still have pushed a lot (into their base, unless you like to drag out ridiculously, or you're up against skilled enemies with heavy pushers). Or, you can gather the entire team and go for the kill (of the Throne/Tree obviously).", "Lucy-chaos machine", "dotastrategy", "http://www.dotastrategy.com/strategy-3133-Lucychaosmachine.html#earlygame", "Doom Bringer", "70");

We will focus on 2 of DK's primary roles which are the tanker and semi-carry of the team.<br/>Early game DK requires safe play and precise farming.Go to middle lane, remember to block creeps so enemy creeps will end up near your tower for last hitting, it should be not that difficult to last hit with DK's decent starting damage and QB, if your opponent is ranged make sure use the A+attack technique to draw in creeps to stay away from harassment try to last hit and deny but always prioritize last hitting than denying use Breathe Fire at level 5 for mass creep killing. Since we are aiming for quick level 16 leave the rune whoring to your other team mates with bottles or to the disablers who might need regeneration or haste to make their ganks, focus on last hitting/denying every wave and stick with your lane to have as much XP and Gold as possible, make sure to let your team know if someone is missing in your lane in order to avoid deaths on your side, if enemy in lane is missing you can choose either of the following options:<br/>1.

Before the clash starts make sure all of your teammates are in the position to back you up, because mindlessly charging into 5 people is just plain retarded w/o your mates around.Rush in and click BKB and stun the first disabler you see, if you don't see the disabler then stun the squishiest member of the enemy that way your team will devour him by that the disabler will finally show up to support his comrades by then quickly shift your attention to him so he will disable you first. If an enemy is dying and is running away don't blindly chase him too far, you might wanna check if your teammates can do okay if you leave them, if you chase the target too far away and even if you manage to kill him, there's a chance that your team might be wiped out due to your absence, keep in mind that you are a tanker FIRST and a semi-carry second, carries are the ones supposed to be chasing the dying ones and not you.

The only hero who's lane control at this point is close is probably huskar (and you don't wanna mess with him for a while). By the time you get to level 3 at the latest you should be harassing the enemy heroes in your lane but keep in mind they are gettin some stronger nukes. If you are up against a dual lane you should focus on just 1 hero this is usually the melee hero if there is one as he will have to come in close to last hit/deny. If there are 2 melee heroes then pick on the one with the least health or the one without an escape mechanism. The only attacking you do should be to last hit, deny or harass. If you are in the hard lane (top sent/bot scourge) and if you are in a dual lane at around level 4/5 and a solo miss gets called be on the defensive. Once you get to around level 6/7 you should think about going back to the fountain and buying some items you should try to farm up 1k gold before you go back but if you can't it doesn't matter. The perfect amount of gold you can get is more than 1700 because with that much you can start getting your core items straight away.", "What you should be doing is farm A LOT without dying and get involved in ganks. You should be getting every last hit in your lane now and also remember to deny creeps when they are on low hp so you don't push too far. If you have pushed too far you will probably notice that some of the heroes have disappeared off the mini map they have probably gone to kill you. If this happens TP out as soon as possible. If there are already heroes after you then try to Silence all the heroes with stuns and TP out.<br/>If there are team fights happening then you should get involved chuck a Silence down to give your team an edge over the other. Make sure you don't run into the action try coming in from behind and throwing down a Silence and Orb Walking their main source of damage.<br/>The main thing is that you are weaker here than in the laning stage and you will be able to dps some heroes, but remember you are still vulnerable to nukes until you get your BKB so don't get too cocky. Its ok to be a little selfish but remember that you are doing it for your team late game.", "This is when drow shines. First when ever you see an enemy hero put Frost Arrows on Auto-Cast this is because by this time in the game you will have such fast attack speed that it is more efficient to have Auto-Cast on rather than Orb Walking.<br/>If you find any lone heroes go around them and HUNT THEM DOWN (that's right i went there). Your teams should be in massive pushes and team fights all the time. Discuss with your team and make sure you focus fire people. You should be focusing the Carry, Disablers, Support, Tanks in that order. Without their carry they won't be doing nearly as much damage. Next you will need to take out at least one of the disablers or their radi carry if they have one. Then their team should fall apart.<br/>Remember if you are focus firing their carry what are they going to do to you??? They will focus you first because you have massive damage now a silence and a slow so it makes sense for them to want to take you out so always be ready to use your BKB/Silence wherever you are or as a last resort run.<br/>Its great to have disablers by your side, but you should at least be able to 2v1 int heroes within the time silence gives. Still as Drow is a fragile hero do not get into the heart of the battle where you will be destroyed by the initiators. The way Drow can destroy other carries in late game is by stopping their game breaking ultis and with her supreme dps output picks off their team 1 by 1.<br/>Play Drow very offensively and be there for the push on every enemy tower.

      VALUES ("Drow if played right, is an incredibly deadly opponent if in the right hands. Her orb effect is incredibly annoying and the slow to both movement and attack speed is very deadly and is completely cost free. AOE silence creates chaos and fear and frost arrows prevents them from fleeing. Her ult allows insane neutral creep farming ability (last hit regular creeps unless pushing of course) with decent attack speed (which my build focuses on). Trueshot Aura is good… late/mid game with agility items (which the build focuses on).", "Go to mid lane or top for Sentinel, and mid or bot for Scourge. Mid is nice because you are within close walking distance to the fountain and Drow should be close to town in order to build her wraiths and treads early. Early game you have two main goals: 1. Stay alive, and 2. farm. Here is my reasoning for buying tangos and circlets: Tangos give you a short burst of regen. You have a very small hp pool. A ring of regen, although very useful, is not as effective when your hp pool can get chipped below a easy nuke limit. You want to have full hp at all times when u do get hit really hard, thus short powerful regen bursts take precedence. The circlets although minor effecting your stats, add in with the stat boots your levels provide giving you a decent early game base damage improvement and focuses on scaling your IAS and damage up to par since your base damage at the stat is very low. You should NOT try to gank anyone this early unless you have an ally and it is easy to slow and kill your opponent. Drow is frail early game and you should never chase people beyond their towers. Stay far back. Early game kills on Drow are extremely bad. Tower hug if you are on top or bottom lane and heroes are missing. EVEN IF ITS THE ONE IN YOUR LANE and you know he could own you. I cannot stress this enough… early game play CAUTIOUSLY with this hero!", "Once you have your treads and wraith bands and a few levels of silence this is the time to start looking for gank opportunities. Your role here is to assist primarily. Go behind someone in their lane who is pushed to far and silence + slow them after you ping for a efficient backstab. In the event of a team battle look for any heroes with channeling abilities or disables. Silence them first, try to get multiple heroes in one silence but primarily try to silence channelers and disablers. Pick off heroes who are low hp and will most likely run instead of fight you, they are easy prey. Pick targets that are int and agility because they have less hp typically and will run instead of fight you. Clear neutral creep camps with your ult whenever you can.<br/>Farm and assist your team. Try to gank with your teammates, don’t gank alone.. You are easy prey for alot of heroes 1v1, use your Lothar’s any time you are getting melee’d by a strong opponent, don’t get cocky.", "This is where Drow really shines. You should have your Butterfly by now and this is when you can single out heroes alone easily, go behind them and open with silence and volley them with arrows. Your attack speed should be high enough to where you can slow them permanently upon ambush and easily kill them before they have time to get away from your freezing wrath. ALWAYS use silence before you attack anyone! this will scare them and make them run. This is what you want to happen. Save Lothars for escaping, don’t use it for ganking unless you know you will be fine. Crush their team in team battles by silencing their most dangerous casters and unleash your speedy barrage of frost. Again, ideally you should be working with your team, so that you don’t have to run in the event of a opponent that rushes you head on .", "Traxex the drow ranger", "dota-utilities", "http://www.dota-utilities.com/2008/11/traxex-drow-ranger-dota-hero-strategy.html", "Drow Ranger", "30");

Earthshaker is the king of trilanes, and with a blink dagger he can easily acquire a rampage. The way the skill build goes spells out how you should play him, with his best spell : Fissure. <br/> This is going to be the main focus of the Guide, a wrong placed fissure can do almost nothing or even get your teammate killed, and I would easily say that this is one of the hardest heroes to play in a trilane as well (correctly). <br/> So, let's talk about the laning aspect. If you are on sentinel, you will want to go bottom lane, hands down. Scourge, you can either go top or bottom. Now the reason to doing this is a simple fact - the treelines and length of lanes and jungles + unobstructed vision.<br/>Here are the reasons for his starting items, though all of those are listed not of all them need to be acquired.<br/> You are a SUPPORTER, therefore rule of thumb: Wards or courier. Split it with another hero that fills in the same role. (if you do fill in the warding category, REMEMBER - 6 MIN = WARD RENEWAL. A supporter who forgets this will usually get his mid solo killed or lose advantage of a rune, whenever I play pubs, 6 minutes is the mid solo gank time for a reason!)<br/> 3 GG Branches- self explanatory, hence the term GG branches :) <br/> Mana potions- these will ensure you many and many kills if you have well placed fissures, so just think of 50 gold as an investment to protecting your own trilane and gold for a mana boots with the kills you get.<br/>Smoke- with your 1200 Range spell, you can guarantee a successful block without revealing yourself to the enemy.", "Kills, kills, kills. Earthshaker used to be a babysit hero in the turtle era, but in the trilane era he needs the exp advantage. Always sit in the jungle with your partner, and try to set yourself up in the right position so that your fissure blocks a hero in your lane, unless they use 2 tangos on trees, they will have to take the long way around and will usually die very fast. Since your hard carry will just worry about cs, the lane will push itself closer to you giving a better opportunity", "This is where we stand on how good an Earthshaker really is. If you have mana boots and blink dagger, good job. If you don't, then you are SOL for those rampage opportunities, this is where his ultimate shines the most. <br/>With the skill build given, all you want to be doing is the same old fissure block, running around with smoke, OR wait for all enemy heroes and creeps pushing a lane to be grouped up so you can jump on them. as soon as you jump on them, use Echo Slam, Fissure, and totem to finish anybody else off. <br/>Why use ultimate first? It gains more damage based on how many units are in an area. Using any other skill will limit the number of units, so maximizing your ult means using it first.<br/>Veil of discord helps a lot too, reduces their magic armor so you can have an AOE party with your friends. Enough said.<br/>Blink Dagger will be your friend, initation, mobility, ganking, chasing, running away and even dodging stuns if you time it right.<br/>Mana Boots will help you early game, but even if you end up not doing so hot you can spam away at lanes and get some easy gold this way, very useful item.<br/>Bottle? IF for some reason, you have trouble with getting 1000 for mana boots, bottle is your friend. Now usually you want to leave runes for a bottle user, but Earthshaker can use it well with a haste or illusion.", "So, this is when Earthshaker is sometimes a pain in the ass. Your spells don't dish out much damage unless there is a substancial amount of enemy creeps, and the stun could be considered mediocre. You are also jumping into a lot of enemies, so certain death is a likelihood for an ES later on.<br/>Your best bet is having some items, starting teamfights right, or having the map under your control. Buy sentry wards to counter your opponents observer wards, run in a pack while using smoke or let the enemy push and jump on them. You can increase your damage output even further by getting an Aghanim's or Shivas, as well as a heart to incease the damage of totem.<br/>Guinsoo is always a good item for supports, so not much need to be said.", "Blocking Earthshaker", "dota2-builds", "http://www.dota2-builds.com/view-dota2-build.php?hero=Earthshaker&id=241", "Earthshaker", "50");

Now, with her pitiful hitpoints, she falls very fast against nukers and is in desperate need for early/mid game survivability. However, considering the nice buffs she received recently, she is now a viable pick and perhaps the most offensive jungler in the game.", "Enchantress is one of those heroes able to jungle effectively from level 1 and onwards. She is also one of the most offensive heroes early game. If your team put you in the jungle, your job is to pressure the lanes next to your jungle, killing heroes and pushing towers. You are not Lycan or Terrorblade, and therefore you should never afk farm in the jungle.<br/>Enchanted creeps are of course the key to a succesful jungling Enchantress (See the mini guide to Enchant for more information about them). Do not forget that they only last for 80 seconds, so spam their spells as much as you can. If you are diving a tower (Most common dive case: you come to a lane, your allies are a dual lane against a solo hero hugging his tower), micro your creep so he goes in first and takes the hits from the tower. If the tower starts hitting you, use your heal; loosing some mana is always better than dying.<br/>You may find various situations, ganking trilanes, solo heroes, dual lanes, ganking mid or a side lane, jungling in your own woods or not, discovering only Wildkins and Hellcallers. Always be agressive early game, but always remember that you are a squishy hero that needs some farm to stay alive.", "Mid game for Enchantress is not a very stable concept. If you are jungling, it starts when you stop the perma gank game. You should have your core items by now, and you can start using Impetus on a regular basis even if you can't spam it.<br/>Mana Management: Your spells are quite cheap (except Nature's Attendants, but it has quite a high cooldown), but they are very spammable, especially Impetus. You should always watch your mana pool. I've seen too many players die because they wasted Impetuses and they didn't have enough mana to use their heal.<br/>Dance around your targets: With her long range (550, or 700 with Agha), her low hitpoints and her orb, Enchantress gameplay is very dependent on kiting and hit and run. Mastering the distance between you and your opponents is what separates an average Ench player from a good one. Staying away (but not too far) even when you have the edge decreases the risks of getting surprised and increases the damage from your ultimate: Less hits to kill someone=less time for the opponents to react and less risks to run out of mana", "Always, always, ALWAYS watch your positioning: Positioning is what keeps you alive and allows you to do your job (DPSing one hero to death with Impetus). You should never be in the very heat of the battle unless it is obvious you are going to win, and even then you should be cautious. A disabled Enchantress with a bad position isn't going to last very long (Remember that little song: One, two, three, dead Bambi). Positioning is also the key to high damage Impetuses.<br/>Your role in teambattles is to focus someone down: When it comes to late game, define your priorities and focus on them until they are dead. You should try to focus heroes with high armor (Impetus rapes them) or with high magic resistance if the rest of your team relies on magical damage. Melee heroes are usually better targets because your slow rapes them (they can't fight back, and you like kiting people).<br/>Spam your spells (besides Impetus): This is also one of Enchantress strenghts late game: Your heal should always be out during teamfights, and you should spam Enchant as much as you can.

Because he's being constantly banned, players often think that he isn't worth mastering, since it's a rare sight to not see him in the ban list. Some even concider playing enigma as booring, since his skills are rather dull, dark, look really slow, not colorful. Enigma is really good at jungling, which gives the opportunity for all 3 lanes to go solo. He's also famous for his fast-farming capabilities, which give opponents a hard time keeping up. Enigma has a lot of mana issues, even with his high int growth, and is very fragile. Here I shall show you the true power of jungling and positioning for enigma.", "Jungle or solo lane. Jungle: hit the jungle. It'll be boring. Going solo is another good option for Enigma. When soloing, you can out-farm any other solo laner with your free deny spell, dominate the whole lane and push at the same time. First thing is to pick a lane. If you're Sentinel, go top, if you're Scourge, go bot. These lanes tend to be safe spots for enemy carries to farm, but as your allied creeps will be close to the enemy tower most of the time, pushing will be very easy. To completely dominate the lane, use demonic conversion on creeps outside of enemy's exp-gain range (1000)", "You should have your blink dagger by now, and lets assume that you're level 9-10. If your team is turtling, then you shouldn't go for a push, instead, help your teammates in ganking. All you have to do is Blink => Convert ANYTHING => Malefice target => Select eldolons and right click on target => Black Hole. Remember to use Black Hole whenever you can, even if it's meant to be used to kill a single target or save an ally (not on creeps, no). If you only have semi-carries, take down a tower a two for some gold. Remember that Eldolons can be used on Meaet Wagons or Glaive Throwers too, so whenever you see one, cast one it (the enemy one), for easy gold and a fast push. If you see an ally in need, spawn Eldolons and order them attack the chaing target. In a lot of cases they would just be too busy chaisng your ally, not caring about 43-51 damage Eldolons shooting them, until it's too late.", "The true moment for Enigma to shine. This is the time where a single Black Hole can decide the outcome of the battle. In this phase, Eldolons lose their usefulness against heroes, but are still powerful for pushes and defending. Malefice's stun is more important now than never, and a single midnight pulse can scare away the whole enemy team. Even without your ultimate, you can still prove your usefulness to your team, by quietly Eldolon + Malefice combo-ing the supporter that stands behind the enemy lines. Midnight Pulse in the middle of the battle and your enemies will have 2 choices:<br/>a) Disperse and get hit while running<br/>b) Continue casting spells/attacking while losing health<br/>Be careful though, timing your blackhole is absolutely crucial.

Disabler and tanks which deal high damage should be still trapped with your Chronosphere. If your team gangs, you shouldn´t use your Ulti because you freeze your allies too. I´ve seen often that some Void players use their Ulti to steal the kill, but don´t do it. First it´s a Ulti waste and second it´s very bad behavior in DotA to steal kills.

As always, when you get close to the enemy, go back and farm neutral creeps. During this time, the enemies will most likely push back, and when the creepwave gets big enough, return, kill them all and repeat the aforementioned process. <br/>Ganking: If an enemy is farming on your lane, call for a gank or move to another one. You should be the one who has to kill, above all because of the expensive items you need to buy.", "With a correct Chronosphere's availment and good team members, you can defeat the enemy at their own towers. If the attack is finished, your team is retreating and you have at least half HP, then you should kill some ancient creep to regain it. It's unlikely for the enemy to go there, as they need to push back the creepwaves.<br/>Also, remember that with The Butterfly you can solo Roshan. If you unfortunately meet the enemy team, don't be too hasty: before escaping, check Roshan's HP and, if it's low, cast Chronosphere, kill it, bring the Aegis of Immortal and then cast Time Walk.", "The Faceless One", "playdota", "http://www.playdota.com/guides/the-faceless-one", "Faceless Void", "70");

But due to his sadomasochistic (mostly masochistic) style of play, he's not very popular amongst competitive players, since he's like a double edged blade. Huskar is a hero who is hard to play, but often concidered a very easy hero to play. This is a common mistake, because he's a hero that requiers a lot more caution and awareness than you think. A single mistake can result in a painful aftermath. Huskar is a strength hero, with a mix of agility, which makes him a good semi-carry, semi-tank. Very agile, also fragile. One of many heroes that requires a lot of skill, and a whole lot of guts.", "Early game is the time for Huskar to shine. Try to be aggressive, but not too aggressive. If your opponents don't have a choice, they'll just run towards you an try to inflict as much damage as they can, which in most situations result in Huskar's death. Throw a couple of spears, grab a creep, deny every single creep that reaches 49% hp. Apply more mental pressure than physical. Never ever right click on an enemy. Always orb-walk to cancel your animation (Huskar has a rather long attack animation backswing). Orb-walking allows you to harass effectively without drawing creep aggro, and llows you to stack more hits (backswing, missclicking happens). Staying on a parallel line with a ranged creep will automatically increase your fear factor, making opponents lose time lane-switching or call for ganks. Be extremely cautious when staying high on the lane. If you see an enemy hero going for a last hit/deny, scare him off with spears. Beware that throwing too much Burning Spears drains out your life drastically fast. You should focus on last hitting to get your power treads. Always check if your ally needs healing, never hesitate saving your ally.", "If you managed to farm at least a part of your core items, it's time for you to go with an ally and wreck some havoc. It's best if you can go with a disabler. Always try to sneak up from behind the enmy while your ally is distracting him, Life Break and grab the kill. The rest of the money for your items will mostly poor in from ganks like this. If you manage to get a blink dagger, then grabbing kills will be much easier. If there's no action going on, grab a few creep kills. During this stage, instead of going home just switch your treads to int form, use Inner Vitality, switch back treads to str form, continue ganking. Remember to autocast arrows before using life break, but when the enemy gets to about 300 range away from you, start orb-walking immediately. Don't forget to activate armlet after Life Break.", "This is the stage, where team clashes are a common sight, and where a slight mistake can change the gameflow. If you have all your core items, then this stage will be a real pain in the neck for your opponents. There are 2 ways you can fight in a teamclash:<br/>1) Blink in first with Inner Vitality, Life Break someone and autoattack, hoping that your allies will follow up.<br/>2) Stand back a bit, wait for the enemy supporters to show up, wait for at least 1 hero of each team begin charging at each other, blink in behind the enemy supporter and profit.<br/>I prefer the second option, but it may sound easy on paper. Sometimes, either you get anticipated, or the enemy disables you just before the final blow. It's best to choose a target, whose role is disabling your ally, not you. If you do so, then he'll waste that disable on you to save his life, giving an opening for your allies to rush in.

Unlike most other skills of most other heroes these only affect the Invoker himself. The reagents grant passive bonuses to various statistics, while Invoke grants access to the Invoker's true spells.<br/>The Invoker can have three reagents active at any given time. Each time you “cast” a reagent it replaces the oldest reagent active. For example if you have Wex Wex Wex active and then activate two Quas reagents, you will have Wex Quas Quas. Should you then activate two Exort reagents your reagent set will be Quas Exort Exort, with the oldest two reagents (Wex and Quas) replaced by Exort. It is good to keep in mind which reagents you have active, for each reagent provides an appreciable bonus to some statistic. These bonuses improve with the reagent’s level and stack with one another.<br/>One important thing to keep in mind when you are switching reagents is that activating a reagent breaks your command chain. For example, if you are walking back to base and you activate three Wex reagents then you will stop moving. The reagent activation interrupted your move command, so you will need to give it again.", "Team battles win or lose games. Initiator Invoker works to make sure his team always comes out on top in these clashes. The three reagents each have a powerful spell that affects a large AOE, and thus are perfect for team battles. These spells - Ice Wall, EMP and Chaos Meteor - are the staples of the Initiator Invoker. His skill and item builds center around creating situations in which these spells have their maximum effect.<br/>No matter how you play the Initiator Invoker you will need to farm early game. Your core is not much larger than that of the Support Invoker, but you need to complete it far sooner. Your initial item is as important to you as Blink Dagger is to Earthshaker, which is to say profoundly. Though some deny and harassment is fine your priority is to last hit.", "Here you are in your element. Get into position (you absolutely cannot afford to miss when initiating) and launch your attack. Once you've used your initiation spell you can switch to something more specific to the enemy hero being focused. Be careful though. You likely will use all three Invoke slots in the first few seconds of a fight, and therefore be helpless if you are focused. Stay on the fringes of the battle if you can, using your ranged attack until Invoke recharges.<br/>Saving an ally is not a high priority. You are less valuable than a carry, but don't suicidally dive in to rescue them. After your initial strike you will be considerably weakened, and unless Invoke or a disabling item is off cooldown you are helpless. No sense in charging in if all you'll be doing is feeding.", "Once you have your core you can help out buying wards. Initiator strategies make you reasonably mobile, and so you can get in and out of places without too much danger.<br/>Your entire game is team fights, so in between them you should be preparing for the next one. If you have full mana/health, go harass the enemy. Save your long cooldown spells for a real fight, but the proper application of cheaper ones like Cold Snap and Forge Spirits can be incredibly frustrating to your target.

Thats all you should be worried about. If they are fragile with short range you can harass them, but don't stray from your objective. Invoker has enough damage with exort that you should not even be trying to go for runes by using lane equilibrium, but to make sure you get every deny and creep kill possible. That brings us to lane equilibrium.<br/>Lane Equilibrium : Using either coordinated attacks, auto attacking or using spells that make your opponent get closer to the tower and therefore gives them the option of losing out on exp or running for the rune. Invoker is not one of those heroes because he is not a great ganker nor is he a bottle hero.<br/>Early lane mindset: If your team has vent or mic, this is VERY useful. If you are doing well enough that you can grab Sunstrike instead of coldsnap, keep an eye out on the map. Getting one or two kills globally will give you a huge advantage. Having a prophet and invoker is a very annoying combo, it guarantees another nuke from across the map which will usually spell out a death for the enemy. The reason why you want the team to be telling you when to Sunstrike is that you don't want to lose concentration on the lane, you will miss denies and csing while trying to micromanage.", "This is where the game gets tricky, you need some quick fingers to make use of Invoker really well here.<br/>Given the skill build, you should be able to dish out 2 spells at once, with a level 2-3 ultimate to swap through the spells in a cycle. You should have most of your 'core' items available to you, although BoT can always be replace with either phase boots or treads, and ultimate stick will take a little more time to acquire.<br/>At this time, you should be able to throw down 4 spells. Here's a quick spell rotation outline:<br/> Initiation with disable and damage: Tornado/EMP -> Def blast and metor<br/>Damage output: Fire spirits/ Alactricity -> Cold snap and def blast<br/>Turtling: Ghost walk/Ice wall -> def blast and EMP (walk up invisible behind opponents to do this)<br/>Long range: Tornado + Sunstrike", "There is not too much to say about this phase of the game, if you've got yourself here chances are you either failed or steam rolled with invoker. On rare occasions invokers do mediocre. So here are some pointers:<br/>Don't get ultimate level 4: If you've got ultimate stick in hand, 4 seconds is plenty of room to be ready for another set of spells. Unless you are very pro and have jackie chan hitting those keys for you, 2 seconds is an overkill.<br/>Make sure you're not getting interrupted: Use a black king bar, a linken's sphere or map awareness and positioning to dish out all of your spells. Most of invoker's abilities can be cast from a safe distance, and he's going to be the first target people attack.<br/>USE ALL YOUR SPELLS!: This is not said enough. Obviously you don't want to lose out on DPS by trying to change your spells, but there are right ways to use everything without wasting time and mana.<br/>Spell rotation late game should always look like this: Nado+ EMP -> Def Blast+ Meteor -> Summons+Alactricity -> Cold Snap+Ice wall<br/>Keep your distance. If you've got some initiation on your team this rotation will bring so much chaos that they won't know where to go. Even with a pushing team, this makes sure your opponents aren't patiently waiting behind a tower.

Besides the ministun effect-which most of the time, disrupts attacking, casting, movement, channeling, etc), it also helps to notify everyone which enemy to attack (especially if you’re the commander). Also used as an emergency skill.<br/>Ghost Walk – your main emergency skill. It is most likely that everyone would use it as an escape mechanism due to its gift of invisibility but there’s a lot more to it. Its slow effect is magical, just follow someone and let someone do something to that someone.<br/> Tornado – this skill is rather amusing. It can be used to scout due to its superior range, It's like an AoE euls for 2.5 seconds only but it has an arival damage which is pretty amazing.<br/>Forge Spirit – spam this. Love this. Always have this.<br/>Alacrity – one of the best support and pushing skill but for me this is the least used.<br/>EMP – a noob killer, and a fantastic lane skill. just cast it in the middle and its either the enemies would flee (so they will be deprived of their experience or any chance on denying or last-hitting) or they would enjoy watching their precious mana disappear. Their call. and whatever decision they make, its your advantage.<br/> Chaos Meteor – your most powerful skill. That’s it<br/>Sun Strike – this skill works wonders, really. My only tip when using this skill, is use it on one target ALONE so that they recieve the full 450 damage.<br/>Ice Wall – one of my favorite skills because it’s huge.

Why aren’t you casting a spell? Don’t attack either”", "Invoke is your priority so get it as soon as you can. Now since its first level starts at level 2, it means that before you learn invoke, you either have one of the three orbs (Quas, Wex and Exort). In every game and every hero, you must consider carefully your first skill and items because roles can be played as early as less than 2 minutes (no creep waves yet). You could be attacking Roshan, clashing on the river, or you can gank or be ganked while level 1 or 2. So make your choice, Quas which creates Cold Snap, Wex which creates EMP, or Exort which creates Sun Strike. For me, I’d prefer Cold Snap because it has low mana cost, low cooldown, and perfect for early ganks. Now, our next priority is to make Exort and Quas level 4 so that we can summon two (2) Forge Spirits. Why? Because it’s better to have company; which is a good addition to your DPS plus it is intimidating so it’s unlikely that you will be ganked when you have two flaming bodyguards on your back. Then after that, while not forgetting to level up your Invoke, you would like to prioritize in maxing out Exort and Wex alternatively. Why Wex? Simply because it adds wheels on your meteor, it reduces the “cost” when you use Ghost Walk (the movespeed reduction), and the best is that you can stop your enemies from attacking for 4 seconds with your Deafening Blast (who wouldn’t want that?).", "This is when Kael is starting to learn and improve more magics. During mid-game, you should prioritize on having your edge on the map and on to your enemies. Gank a lot and push a lot. You’ll need to use most of his skills now but not all every time because your mana isn’t enough unless you have Orchid. Always summon Forge Spirits and spam Alacrity either to yourself or another DPSer like Drow Ranger especially on towers.<br/>First thing to consider is your fragileness and Vanguard solves the problem like a bonus question. Yeah it does because it’s cheap, useful item requirements, and still effective during late game. Next is your mana. Orchid kinda does the job instantly because of its 225% mana regen and its components are cute. (Yeah you should always consider the item components because you need everything anytime everywhere). Next to consider is your usefulness, versatility and potential – AGHANIM’S SCEPTER. With this you can use all your skills in 1 clash. That’s it. Then go for BoT next .", "Oh no!

Have you ever wanted to play a spellcaster while still being extremely strong and tanky? If so, then Jakiro is the hero for you. Jakiro is a very tanky spellcaster that offers a lot to a team, whether it is the ability to push at an insane rate, slow his enemies’ movements, or deal tons of damage. Although he requires a good amount of set-up in order to benefit from his array of spells, Jakiro is an absolute monster when used properly.", "Jakiro’s lane can vary depending on the type of heroes you have. He is great in both the top lane and bottom lane, so send him to the lane where he will be needed most. During the laning phase, do your best to last hit and deny. Use your Dual Breath from afar to gain multiple last hits at once while also hurting the enemy heroes.<br/>Make sure to right click all of the creeps a little bit so they will all die at once when you use your Dual Breath, giving you lots of gold and experience. Use your large farm potential to rush your Ring of Basilius and Arcane Boots so that you can quickly push the lane and start killing their towers. Also make sure to use your Liquid Fire on their tower as much as possible so that you can slowly kill it off.", "If you’ve laned successfully, you should now have a Ring of Basilius, Arcane Boots, and have your Urn of Shadows done. Your Mekansm should also be up by around the 22-25 minute mark. Your role now is to help support your other teammates, push lanes, and engage in team fights. With a level 4 Dual Breath and a level 2 Macropyre, you are a very scary dragon and can deal a lot of burst damage and DOT damage.<br/>Your Dual Breath should be used constantly during battles to hurt and slow as many people as possible, while your Macropyre should be used to blanket the battlefield with fire. You can also push towers really easily by spamming out your Dual Breath, using your Liquid Fire to burn and slow towers, and healing your creep and allies with your Mekansm and Urn of Shadows. Also remember to keep buying wards, as having continuous map vision is great for your team and will give all of you a greater sense of security and control while also allowing you to push and gank with ease.", "You should now have your core supporting items and be working up to your Scythe of Vyse. Scythe of Vyse will make you an incredibly tanky Support caster, making it very hard for the opposing team to kill you.

This can be enough time for your team to catch up to you and kill that person, or for you and the carry to destroy them on your own.<br/>It is also great for disabling any other enemy that was not caught in your Ice Path, giving you the power to basically disable the entire opposition with 2 spells. Try to stay alive for as long as you can during these fights by always popping off your Mekansm and Pipe whenever possible. Surviving is one of the best things you can do for your team so that you can always supply them with a lot of damage, slows, and stuns.

      VALUES ("Jakiro currently isn't used much, neither in competitive DotA nor in public games. That doesn't mean that he's a bad hero though. He is a fun hero to use, all his 3 active skills require some sort of aiming, positioning and timing for maximum effect. He is a very potent pusher and has loads of AoE-spells up his sleeve to create havoc in clashes. Unfortunately he has trouble with teams that focus on armor reduction, which are rather common these days... His teamfight-presence is easily countered by Blademails, Pipes and Hoods.", "Usually you shouldn't solo THD. he can do it np, but he doesn't really need the money and experience. He will, however, most likely be able to push the tower in no time. Jakiro shines in offensive lanes. He can make for some nasty dual-lane with Clockwerk, Juggernaut, Sand King, Sven, stuff like that. Especially clockwerk works great, creeps die so battery is more effective, enemies get slowed so he can reach them. You should usually be the one intiating due to Dual Breaths huge range, then wait for your ally to make his move and follow with Ice Path. <br/>Jakiro is a very strong laner, i advise you to take advantage of that and not leave your lanepartner alone to solo-gank when there is no need for it, let alone roam.<br/>Use Dual Breath rather liberately for harrass, but save mana to go for a kill with your ally if a good situation arises. Try to get at least one creep when harrassing a hero, or even better harrass both heroes with one breath. don't walk up to them like an idiot though, stay rather close to the creepwave and breath them when theyre moving in for a lasthit. That's pretty easy considering its huge range. Use the slow of dual breath to get some extra attacks in for harrass. Be careful with creep aggro, you only have 400 range and mediocre animation. Due to your low armor you might end up taking more damage from creeps than you dealt to your enemy with your attack.", "THD is a fairly decent ganker if you know how to aim your stuff. Dont forget that your spells are AoE, you can easily hit 2 targets with Dual Breath, same goes for a well aimed Ice Path. <br/>Usually you'd want an ally to start the gank with a stun so you can chain Ice Path, if thats not possible try to start with Dual Breath so its easier to land Ice Path. Both Ice Path and Dual Breath have decent range, keep that in mind. You dont have to put yourself in too much danger to use them effectively. Use Macropyre when you're sure the target is gonna be disabled for some time and actually takes some damage, if the enemy hero isn't very tanky it's usually a waste against a single target.", "Quite simple. Use Dual Breath to clear creeps, and always try to get Liquid Fire off on the tower, ideally on both the tower and the creepwave. Pushing is one of the few things THD can do completely on his own, a bit like Brood - just be more careful, you can't spin a web!<br/>If the tower is going to die and your opponents are getting ready to deny, you can use Ice Path to keep them from doing so and gtfo. Alternatively you can blow out Macropyre and Dual Breath afterwards and go for a kill or two, depending on the situation.<br/>Don't initiate with Macropyre, at least not like your regular initiator (Tide/ES/SK/etc.). Try to read the battle. Do you have an allied AoE disabler? Drop Macropyre where he catched some, dual breath them and extend the disable with Ice Path. You do not have an allied AoE disabler? Well that blows. Jakiro really likes those. No worries though, you're still far from useless. Battles usually aren't stationary, try to foresee in which direction 2+ enemy heroes that are close to each other will move (works great if they are focusing one of your allies), and drop Macropyre there, dual breath before or after, dependant on the situation. Ice Path generally should be used after macropyre, if you cast Ice Path and Macropyre afterwards they will barely stand one second in it.

Proudmore is a highly ranked competitive tier hero capable of soloing and winning a lane against a solo ranged or weak hero combination. He has a set of useful delay-cast AoE tools which include a great initiation stun/debuff in Ghost Ship, a small-aoe disable and slow in Torrent, and one of the best chasing spells in the game, X marks the spot. He also has one of the best last-hitting and denying abilities in the game in Tidebringer, rivaling Nethertoxin in raw power. Tidebringer is also great for harassment, allowing you to harass well even as melee.", "Levels 1-7 you're going to be laning hard. In competition, Admiral is generally going to be run Solo Mid, but can also do well in the long lane (Top for Sentinel, Bot for scourge), with a targeted stunner (to set up torrents; use the aggressive Torrent build for this lane). Just watch your + damage to que your Tidebringer, and try to land the cleave splash on heroes. If they play back and aren't threatening (melee's and... just melee's lol), play up on the ranged creep to deny them experience and land cleaves, but be wary of ganks, otherwise just chill out. If you're in trouble (dual stunners, strong combinations, etc), CALL FOR GANKS OFTEN. Get those early kills/fountain trips so you can get your farm in. A Kunkka with no items is squishy and not much of a threat, though still a good initiator. A dead Kunkka and farmed opponents is worse.<br/>With a lanemate, every time they can land a stun or slow, try to pop a torrent and a cleave and as many extra hits as you can while you have an advantage, but don't linger if there is no kill waiting for you. 2 hits + no damage > 4 hits and 200-400 damage, and it adds lane pressure. That's how you win a dual lane and you can do it almost every time with Admiral.", "After the laning stage at around level 7-10, or if by some miracle your lane breaks the tower earlier, you want to start ganking things. As a general rule, you want to land one kill per ultimate cooldown, and farm well in between. What you need for good ganks are:<br/>1) Mana; check it.<br/>2) A safe place to initiate from. If no towers are broken you want to help a lane push to give you more space to chase.<br/>3) A few good partners. The more the merrier, but overkill can be wasteful.<br/>Helpful things include Wards, Runes, and landing a good Boat.<br/>During this stage of the game, a good combination of map awareness and control should net you and your homies a few kills, and most importantly, space for your team and carry to farm and get caked up. You should have your phase boots by now and carry two TP scrolls at ALL TIMES. One to get in, one to get out. Again, TP Scrolls are only 135g, that's 3 creeps or a few assists.", "Around level 13 or so, the game changes to the point where 1v1 and laning is fairly worthless; there is only freefarm, gank and push. At this point you want to be positioning yourself to take towers and press advantages, and farm the jungle in the off time. Use map control to force them to stay in their jungle and not farm the lucrative creep waves, and press the creep against their tower. Once you get a +2 hero advantage, push damage towers as much as you can to gain map control and farm space. Your cleave eats creep at this stage, and you get a +60 hit on the tower every 4 seconds <br/>Ideally, your second main item should come before level 16, so as a team, you want to be set up to win around 16-18 with a good Boat/Torrent setup or just pressing on their mid tower with your massive cleave to clear the creep. Admiral can semi-carry, but a hard carry or a combo of good semi-carries like Admiral/PotM is recommended to step up around this level and get the win.", "Feat T-Payne", "playdota", "http://www.playdota.com/guides/feat-t-payne", "Kunkka", "50");

Your early mana problems are solved, and her Frostbite and your Torrent combine to make a deadly laning combo. Last hit as much as you can, as your laning combo will make the opponents be more defensive. If the support hero plays properly, you should be able to farm quite easily.

However, at the same time Leshrac is gifted with Lightning storm, which makes for easy last hitting in lane (while harassing), and Diabolic Edict, which makes short work of towers when the enemy is not around. Played carefully enough during early and mid game, Leshrac can amass a large amount of gold from creep kills, tower kills, and hero kills to be a powerful pushing and teamfight force during late game.", "This build preferably takes a mid-lane or a solo long lane (with access to the secret shop).  If you are solo long, then you will need to keep wards up around yourself to prevent ganks as Lightning Storm tends to push the lane.  In a solo long lane, you may also choose to level Diabolic Edict sooner and prioritize movement speed so that if the enemy ever decides to go aggressive on you, they will take a lot of damage chasing you past the creep wave. <br/> With a solo lane, getting a fast Void Stone can make things a lot easier.  With a steady supply of mana, use Lightning Storm to last hit 1-2 creeps per wave while harassing the enemy hero.  Careless players will leave themselves open to kills, but do not be too aggressive and try to prioritize creep kills. <br/> If you are mid, then make sure to get a bottle quickly and pay attention to runes. Ganks work well with Lightning Storm's low cooldown and Diabolic Edict's high damage away from creep waves.  However, this build does not prioritize leveling Split Earth considering that the stun duration is constant across levels.  This limits your ability to stun multiple enemies at once during ganks, so it may be best to stay mid depending on the composition of heroes", "Prioritize taking down towers over engaging in team fights.  This will allow you to quickly build a Bloodstone as well as help your teammates get quick items as well.  (This is why the build suggests learning a second level of Diabolic Edict before Pulse Nova).  If the enemy team starts looking for team fights, you can often sneak into other lanes (while the enemy is away) and take down tier one towers within one or two creep waves.  Do not take down tier two towers without support from allies but do not be afraid to push when given the opportunity.  If you can acquire money quickly, it will make late game a lot easier. <br/> During team fights, try to stay at the back of the battle until people are low health.  This build does not suggest building early health items (beyond Bloodstone components) so you will not last long if you are the center of attention.  Keep a steady supply of lightning storms when off of cool-down but save enough mana for Diabolic Edict and a few Pulse Nova pulses (math is helpful here, so identify how much damage you plan to do and how much mana is required. Unless your team has many AoE disables, do not count on getting more than 3-4 pulses of damage on any given hero).

      VALUES ("Leshrac has been my favorite hero since I first started playing around three years ago. It’s hard not to like the quintessential glass cannon that he represents, and there’s hardly a battle that a well positioned, well equipped Lesh cannot swing to his team’s favor. I want to save you all the trouble I went through in learning Lesh’s greatest strength, which hinges on the enemy’s inevitable attraction to attacking him. You will not find another hero in DoTA that is so frequently the first target in team fights, and few are such a sought after gank target. I call this the Tetraodontidae Technique because Tetraodontidae are a family of fish who at first appear unassuming and weak, but upon being attacked, they puff up in a mass of poisonous spikes, killing their would-be predator. Soon you will discover how to turn Leshrac into a similarly unassuming Tetraodontidae; so please, read on.", " You are not weak during this period, but it is your most vulnerable time. Last hit carefully, harass when able, and land whatever nuke you chose to both harass the enemy and last hit creeps (simultaneously is best). Use those clarities, too. Your enemy is likely to underestimate you, especially if you get Diabolic Edict early. At level 2, Diabolic Edict can pump 800 damage to a lone target, which is nothing to sneeze at in the early game. If a player wants to stand toe to toe with you because every other Leshrac he's ever played got nothing but Split Earth and Lightning Storm, you should kindly oblige him, then light his ass on fire. One thing to remember: when using Diabolic Edict or Pulse Nova, do not dance around like an idiot. Keep attacking, that's what makes the spells so good, they fight with you, not for you.", "Your mid game centers around three items: Bloodstone, Blade Mail, Black King Bar. Generally by the time you finish all three of these, mid game is at least beginning to transition to late game, depending on how well you've done pushing towers and how many heroes you've killed. If you find that by the time you get your early game items and grab your point booster you are extremely underfed and behind, I recommend grabbing Boots of Travel as fast as you can. Travels are good for catching up when you are behind on gold, but I find them to be too expensive to be worth the gold otherwise. If you aren't falling behind and your team is working together and getting proper ganks, pushing towers, etc., town portals should work just fine. If, on the other hand, your team is not working together well and your lanes are not being kept under control, Travels provides a way for you to pick up the slack and grab the gold in those unchecked creeps. I grab travels early maybe 2 out of 15 games.", "Late game your attack strategy changes very little from Mid Game with the exception of Veil of Discord, which allows you to increase your damage output by 25%. You should generally cast Discord before any other spells; the attack sequence otherwise remains the same. Use your travels for lane control, Lesh is one of the best late game lane controllers in DoTA, and try to rax the enemy when they aren't expecting it. Whatever you do, be present in team fights, you are a huge force in throwing the fight to your team's favor.", "Tetraodontidae Technique", "playdota", "http://www.playdota.com/guides/tetraodontidae-technique", "Leshrac", "60");

Because that way, you have access to the 2 rune spawn areas. so you could keep on recharging your bottle. You're also the nearest to the Secret Shop, making the trip to buy a perse shorter. You also have the option to start a gank on bottom or top lanes if you just recharged your bottle, then buy 2 tps, and go back to the Middle lane. But normally go either Bottom or Top, it doesn't matter since you'll be pretty much more of a support in a lane rather than the farmer. Your role is to harass and possibly kill the enemies in the lane with the help of heroes<br/> Farming: Provided you have a below average base attack early on(45-49), your projectile's a bit slower than most(900 missile speed) and a long backswing animation of about 0.8 seconds, animation cancelling to everything Leshrac does is a must. Not only it saves time to chase, it also helps you dodge some megannoying things like Meat Hook and Elune's Arrow.", "Pushing: By the time you have Bloodstone, spamming skills doesn't cost much now. Much more if you have charges(which is most likely by now). <br/>Killing: The problem now is if you're not in a lane. Since we've been killing enemies in the lane via harass->go-4-kill, we would have to leave Pulse Nova on, follow them and wait for Split Earth and Lightning Storm to cool down. Be careful about them sidestepping. Because most people wouldn't run in a straight line, they use maneuvers that may help them escape while your stun is in cooldown.<br/>Clashes: Since mid-game is when carries farm for their lives, and they start defending their base because you guys need to push... and the other way around, Clashes are inevitable. And your role in these Clashes are simple: Use ALL of your skills and GET IN THERE, Stand your ground while attacking, stunning, using lightning bolt, and Pulse Nova-ing, and Retreat when appropriate, Take out those major damage dealers in a clash first like Earthshaker, Enigma, Venomancer, and Tidehunter.", "Thanks to Bloodstone, Kelen's/Guinsoo, no matter how fed you are, carry heroes still outshines you in the game.

Since you've been pushing like mad, I'd like to point out that After you get your high-tier item, IMMEDIATELY GET BoT . I hope that you guys have Destroyed at least their 2nd tower. And even if you guys are owning, a situation where the tables are turned because their carry was able to farm because of super defending, from what i've seen/played, is highly possible.

With all seriousness aside, the Lich IS my favourite hero of DotA. He is awesome, he is unbelievably effective early to mid game and looks crazily cool. Hope you enjoy reading my guide.", "The Middle lane is recommended for Lich purely because he is a Ranged hero and the opposition usually brings ranged heroes to this lane. However, it may be a good idea to accompany a Close-Combat hero on your side against a ranged foe in a different lane.<br/>With a decently leveled FROST NOVA and possibly with the force of CHAIN FROST, when the opportunity arises, consider taking a trip to TOP or BOT lane to help gank opposition heroes. The slow effect as well as the great damage provided could just be the edge your team needs to make a deadly push towards the Objective. The DARK RITUAL skill provides Lich with an endless supply of MANA throughout the game. Use this to your advantage! Earlier on, Lich suffers from a lack of MANA due to the high costing nature of his spells and sometimes, the MANA cost of Activation Items (Mekansm).<br/>During the course of play, make sure you regularly FROST NOVA your opponents to force them back. Then Replenish your MANA by using DARK RITUAL on a suitable creep. This usually is a full-health creep or one that needs a deny just before the opposition makes the money-making kill. Remember, the more HP the unit has, the more MANA you replenish, and the TANK creeps (Treant or Ghoul) is more recommended than the ranged creep (Druid or Necro).", "During this phase, the Mekansm should have been completed and you should be well on your way into the Sceptre. During this phase of the game, the main idea is to make tower pushes by ganking heroes or taking them out by yourself as much as you can. You shouldn't be lacking MANA as much as earlier on because of the items required to make the Soul Booster.<br/>LICH STRATEGY (CHAIN FROST + FROST NOVA)", "The Lich is not as effective in LATE game as he was in the earlier stages of the game. It is imperative that you make your dominant stand in the earlier games to have a powerful effect on the later stages of the game. During this phase, the Lich's role is to support his allies by providing emergency heals, emergency armour and mass-damage with his CHAIN FROST whenever necessary. Pushing and Defending on-queue and on-time is a definite must as this can alter the result of the game. Do not try to solo enemy heroes as chances are, that they will be stronger than you 1 on 1.

And don't back off unless you HAVE to, the second you stop hitting you stop stealing HP, very problematic, you have no defense from spells unless you got a BKB or a Linken's so careful. USE Infest, it's not useless and is very versatile, example: you're close to one of the enemy's towers, you see him close to yours on the minimap and a wave of his creeps on the way there, why not Infest one of them and pop out ontop of him, most of the times he wont even move 2-3 secs because it'll take him time to realise he's attack, and then its too late, 3secs could differ a Kill from a failed attempt.", "You're almost unbeatable 1on1 IF you chose the right items and play properly.<br/>Don't mind creeps/tower hitting you while you fight another hero.<br/>You can solo towers easily.<br/>Getting money is still important until you get all your gear.<br/>Ambushing is not as important (infest,attacking from behind) BUT still very recommended, especially if they are scared of you.<br/>Timing your skills is always important.<br/>Try avoiding attacking 2 or more heroes without BKB or a Butterfly (depends vs which heroes ofcoures, disablers BKB evasion/high dmg butterfly)<br/>Again if you see a low hp hero, even from far away, run straight to him, nothing to lose + you run fast.<br/>Hero Killing: <br/>Disablers: 1. ALWAYS activate Armlet seconds BEFORE you attack, preferably before you're in range of their disable spell/s. 2. Rage quickly after so they can't disable you, if Disable won't make them kill/escape as the battle starts skip this phase and go 3.Disable is casted and wears off, if they are on low hp use Open wounds, also use Rage ONLY if you know they have another disable or their disable's Cooldown finished, OR if you know you'll need it inorder to finish them off , If they are not low on hp skip this phase go 4.

      VALUES ("Lina is one of the most powerful nukers in the game, having a spell combo of three active damage nukes(+disable) and therefore tramendous roaming/ganking abilities. She is like a much more aggressive version of Lion. Nowadays, Lina can be commonly seen supporting on 3ple lane or roaming. However, this is not her standart role, because she lacks natural support abilities. I am up to provide you one more option - soloing. This is an option mainly because of her level dependancy and her tremendous power at ganking right after level 6. Also, soloing is the only secure way to have influance on the middle game. ", "Go in lane and choose a primary target by checking your opponents' health, consumables, skills, etc. and attack it. Last hitting is not that important in double lane and your mate will probably need it the most. Concentrate on harassing - 625 attack range and AoE disable are to help you. Never miss an opportunity to place Light Strike Array when you can hit both(or all) your opponents with it. Keep your mana at least at 50%, but don't miss a chance to kill also.<br/>If things in lane go well and your ally can cope by himself, don't lose your time there. Make a camp pull, check the rune, go gank if needed.<br/>If you play smart enough, not to lose all your mana points, Boots should come first. Once having them, you should be able to place Light Strike Array much better - make use of it. The very next item should be bottle if soloing/roaming. If not, just finish your Phase Boots.<br/>When you get to level 6, don't go for the first kill possible. Be patient. You can kill every hero on the map, decide which one will be best. Carries and solo laners have the priority here. After this point, you should never stop roaming.", "Here is your peak. You got all your nukes now and it's time to start killing intensely. Map awareness is the key. Always watch your position and keep an eye on the minimap. Go for every rune. Use terrain advantage on your side - as an example, when beinig chased a highground + Light Strike Array can save your life. Note that Light Strike Array also destroys trees - this should prevent your opponent from continuous juking.<br/>When ganking don't rush Light Strike Array if your opponent is not near enough. Wait for your ally or wait him go wrong. Once you have your Eul's/Dagger this will no longer be a problem.<br/>Eul's has the priority, because it provides the much more needed: Int, Mana regen, MS, Disable. These are a dream team for the middle game of every nuker. It is Ok to delay Dagger because of this, but don't delay it too much. If for any reason things don't go well, just go for another item - Janggo, Ghost Scepter or just some Bracers will help you survive.", "Although a heavy nuker, you are far from powerless even in Late game. All the strategies of Middle game are still viable here. Because of Fiery, now you are capable of combining both physical and magical damage in battle. This is to help you against magic immunity and high HP pools, which are both common in Late game. You still have two disables, so all you have to do is to position yourself and wait for your time.<br/>Even if you get caught, having Eul's, Dagger, Ghost Scepter and Hex, your opponent will surely lose a lot of time (trying) to kill you. Notice that all these items are good both for attacking and protective purposes. You are not an easy one to take down.<br/>All you have to do in order to finish the game is win a decisive team battle. Gem is something to help you do this - you have no more important items now, use your gold to buy one if needed.

Her two main offensive spells provide a powerful area of effect combo. Dragon Slave fires a quick fiery projectile which deals good damage and has pretty high range. Light Strike Array is Lina's stun spell. Due to her relatively slow cast time it can be difficult to hit moving enemies with this spell, however. Many Lina players cast Light Strike Array right after an ally uses another stun, making the spell much easier to hit and prolonging the total disable time. To support her offensive gameplay style, Lina has a passive skill called Fiery Soul. Every time she casts any of her other spells, Lina gains a temporary movement and attack speed bost, allowing her to chase down and kill fleeing enemies. Lina also has the most damaging single-target spell in the game: Laguna Blade. This devastating blast of energy is one of the best ways to finish off injured enemies.

Like I said, observer wards are useful to you since you're a ganker and it makes lone ganks easier so put observer wards in the farming areas. Heroes like Troll, Void, Slardar or Traxex are going to farm in the farming areas and kick your butt in late game so better not let them farm at all. Once you have observers wards and planted them, hunt them and kill them with your burst spell combo. Don't gank and kill heroes who are laning too often because they'll run away from you unless, again, you have someone with you; you have Kelen's Dagger, Rod of Atos, Shiva's Guard or Guinsoo Staff; or if you're skilled in landing your Light Strike Array.", "When it comes to a clash between your team and the opposite team suddenly begins, keep your distance while a tanker or an initiator makes the trigger or call for clash.

Unleash your Finger of Death if you feel like a hero should and could be bursted down by your teammates, or else saving it to finish a hero (better if it was almost) or before you die if the situation calls for it.<br/>You should try and stay alive so you can come back for the second round of disables. BKB helps with that, but you need to be out of the line of fire first If you somehow finds yourself the lone survivor with 3+ enemy heroes staring at you, and you have Blink not on cd and/or disabled, what do you do?", "So much harder than your average dps Lion I'm afraid. You have to know what you're doing, never go alone since your nuking combo have probably lost a lot of effectiveness. Don't hesitate to use your skills and sometimes being the bait is good, since you are this hero with a big 'kill me' sign, of course you must have had BKB and some survivability items to make this work.

I propose a different outlook for Banehollow, moreover, with this strategy I hope with optimism that Banehollow would be viewed differently.", "Preferably go for the bottom lane if you’re in the sentinel side and top lane if you’re in the scourge’s side and go solo. Because these are the lanes closer to your tower which is advantageous for melee heroes to avoid getting harassed while last hitting and denying creeps at the same time. And if your assigned into a different lane make sure you block the creeps so that you could still tower hug. If you’re assigned with another teammate then better if it’s a disabling, slowing or stunning hero so kills would come easy for later on. Follow the basics stated above and you will be able to farm for exp and gold easier. Stay patient when going up against nukers and harassers use your wolves in farming instead and leech at the sides for exp and remember to move constantly to avoid being a easy target (do not activate level 1 wolves!). At level 3 summon wolves is where you start to harass and keep them from getting the gold and exp. This is where creep pulling and blocking helps greatly, because the farther your enemy hero from their tower the longer the distance of the wolves to chase him down and keep them from farming. Remember not to auto attack and just last hit the creeps (refer to basics) use your wolves as scouts to scare away enemy heroes.<br/>At this stage survivability, leveling, and farming is your prime importance. So stay as serene as you can and avoid being killed. As much as possible destroy the first tower in your lane as fast as you can. At level 5 you can destroy the first tower in your lane. I’ve done this many times before and this is very easy actually. The trick here is to always pull their creeps but at the same time kill them fast", "This stage is where you become known and should start to get the kills. At this part is where fear begins to creep in to the minds of those with fragile hearts as soon as they see you in your wolf form. He can kill a full HP hero just by chasing them down while biting their arses! You heard me right, but even those with disabling skills, stunning skills or slowing skills. But if you sense that you are still too weak to go up against the enemy heroes then you should continue to farm in your lane and neutral creeps. Remember that hunting for heroes all the time and failing at killing delays you from getting experience and gold. So when your ulti is still cooling down remember to keep farming. At this juncture heroes starts to establish their ganks and move across the river unto your side in groups to look for kills. So be careful, always look out for missing heroes and when farming for neutral creeps use your wolves as sentries to avoid feeding to the enemy (refer to skills of your skills)<br/>Farm, farm, farm! Always assess the situation before doing something too aggressive. If you get ganked do not hesitate to use your wolf form to get away from sticky situations. Team up with your allies in getting effective kills. You’re a chaser! But do not get carried away in chasing down farther to the enemy territory alone for it may be you who would get ganked in return.", "Here is when you amend from being a Hero Killer to a Pusher. Why? Ultimately the purpose of pushing is to destroy the towers and eventually finish the game. Would you rather be beyond godlike and lose? or killing spree and win? Well, I like being beyond godlike and winning at the same time like the next guy does! But anyway, late game is when team clashes would happen more often since they would want to kill as many heroes as possible to be able to push further without interruptions which would be your team’s goal as well. Remember to activate your howl constantly which costs few mana as it contributes a lot in your efforts in pushing. Don’t push just to destroy a tower and get killed a long the way. NO! NO! This is not worth it at all because respawn time takes too long at this stage and most likely the enemy can kill creeps so fast that your tower would be destroyed faster that you did theirs.<br/>However don’t forget that you are still a Hero killer so most likely you’d still be able to pawn a couple of heroes and push at the same time.

There are many arguments going around on how max speed necros+wolves can be a beast in teamfights but I doubt it works everytime. Kinda iffy as it relies quite heavily on the skill of the player, and his micro. You see, I'm a lazy person who prefers to win games through the easiest method. Which is exactly the intent and purpose of this guide. So back to the idea. You will be using wolves+necroboys to assist you in your Solo pushes. You will only summon them when you are taking down a tower or a rax, and for the very reason you do not summon them during teamfights. Necroboys for teamfights means no necroboys for pushes. In fact, you should avoid teamfights altogether!

Worry not, carry on with the usual laning. You can start pulling again around 6min onwards after the ward expires<br/>As you start jungling fulltime, they will take notice and send gankers to hunt you in the woods. Keep an eye on the minimap<br/>If the enemy team consists of many early gamers, they will be interested in doing an early team push to force you out of the jungle to defend.  This is where your first opportunity to push opens up. As they team push, you sneak into their pushed lane and take down their towers. One for one.", "Okay so by now you already have a Necro1 and your opponents are probably laughing their ass off looking at your noob item build. That's good cos it's a sure sign they will ignore you which is exactly what you want. Your allies will be bitching as well, fine. Tell them you won't help in teamfights. Pretend to QQ. This is good because you don't want allies to be too hopeful to help them during teamfights. High expectations can ruin games. Make them feel it is a 4v5 and they will play more cautiously, smartly and learn to be self-sufficient.<br/>By the time you reach Necro3, your opponents wouldn't be taking you lightly anymore. They know what you are capable of and try to find counters. Well, there aren't many. Necro3 are mighty hard to kill with spells, and the blue guy can be quite scary to kill. Enchantress can enchant the boys but who would suspect during the picking phase that you will be going Necro Lycan, right? HotD & Diffusal can work too but these are items which takes some time to build. It is not like you have warlock on the other team that screams 'must-get-diffusal' right from 0:00 min. Bottom line is, when they realise your One-man army is unstoppable, it is already too late.", "Once the outer towers have been cleared, the enemy will be forced to turtle. What you need to do is constantly push all the three lanes to keep your creeps as close to the enemy tower as possible. Make use of BoT and Shapeshift to swing from lane to lane. This is so reduce the time needed to push into their base whenever an opportunity arise (say a teamfight suddenly breaks out at mid) and to avoid people screaming backdoor.<br/>The beauty of Lycan is that he doesn't need to push a specific lane. His One-Man Army has the ability to tank towers. You can push in from the bottom lane, and instead of raxing the tower, you dash into their base and whack the top lane tower instead. It makes you like an idiot which isn't a bad thing really. At this stage of the game, you will want to make yourself as unpredictable as possible. Yes, like an idiot. Create as much confusion as possible and avoid the conventional norms. Like ugh, all 5 heroes pushing the same lane etc. 5 vs 5 teamfights are exciting but it doesn't always win games. Remember, this is all about meta-gaming. If you make yourself unpredictable, they can never come up with a suitable counter since they can never read your moves.

Lycan is absolutely useless in a lane being melee and having no slow/stun, and the benefits of having two solo lanes and getting more money from jungle is too great to be overlooked. I would suggest picking Lycan when your allies have two good solo heroes and are arguing over who should solo mid. Lycan jungling opens up top to be a solo lane, but bear in mind that some solos who can do well in mid ( against a single hero and with bottle rune ) will suffer against a dual lane ( examples are Pudge, clockwerk ).

Puck, Mirana ).", "As I have mentioned before, Lycanthrope excels in midgame DPS with the combination of his howl, passive, ulti and wolves. So it is clear that you should be killing heroes.

Lurk around in the woods ambushing enemy heroes with your allies, and while you're at it, kill neutrals as well. Help your team push down towers so that you have map control.

A complete package is what Mirana is, and I hope you guys enjoy this guide. This guide correlates to the current DotA scene (6.6x). Before you read this guide, I will not hold your hand.

You can get that potential gold through effective last hitting, so do not sweat it.<br/>When you play Mirana, there will be plenty of opportunities to kill in the Laning Phase and those opportunities will increase when you have a capable partner with you. Gauge your opponent, predict, shoot off an Elune's Arrow, then just wack them dead. Early Game kills are all about confidence and coordination with your allies. Even though I did not tell my ally Sniper I was going to try to kill Juggernaut, he was smart and reacted when he saw the Elune's Arrow (some people just sit there and attack creeps). So if you ever see the opportunity to get a kill, then go ahead and take it. Just be sure you will either kill the person or get away safely if you do not.", "'Marina MIA' You will make your enemy fear those words. You have to! It is the only way to be effective. You do not have to be the most efficient Mirana player, missing out on kills is a-okay although way more beneficial to you if you do get the kill. The point in this style of play is to strike fear in your opponents, to make them go back to base, and lose out on opportunities for gold and experience. If you are constantly on the move, seizing every possible opportunity, your opponents will be on their toes. They will play more careful, but they will also open wider windows for opportunities to strike. When a door closes, another opens. <br/>Despite all of that motivational talk, you will not be constantly on the move UNLESS you are benefiting from every single kill by garning the experience as well. Essentially, you will just be scaring enemy heroes away from their lane. You will then use that time to farm that lane for a little while, then you will move onto the next victim. 'Why? Did you not just say that Mirana is not Item dependent Early-Middle Game?' Did you forget there is a Late Game too? Late Game requires Mirana to have certain items to be effective; otherwise, she will be fodder for the Carries.<br/>To sum all that up: Ganking and Farming requires a nice balance between the two for Mirana to be effective at all stages of the game, from Early to Late Game.

Given the fact that she needs a lot of practice to control properly it also makes it much more fun to play her, especially when you reach the level where your enemy roars in despair and accuses you for having maphack and aimbot.<br/>Shooting Elune's Arrow is not like throwing a Storm Bolt. You have to aim and time it. The very first lesson is the most basic and important one: Do not click directly on the target when you shoot your arrow. Always aim and time it and click on the ground. <br/>Clicking on the target itself makes the arrow's trajectory odd and you will almost never hit it like this. Instead, time the arrow, think ahead of your enemy and guess where he's going to run. When you think you've got a clear shot and a correct estimation, shoot and (hopefully) hit. This technique is going to take a lot of practice but once you master it you can damage and stun your opponents over cliffs, hills, corners and whatsoever for a crapload amount of damage and stun them for nearly 5 seconds. Here are a some situations.", "As Mirana is a strong solo hero, a solo lane would be prefered, but a double lane isn't too bad either especially not if you lane with a disabler. Now, as all other heroes, start last hitting and denying. Try to harass your enemy(ies) by hitting them a few times on occasions. From level 3 you should start to look for an opening in your enemy's defense. If you see a good moment for an arrow, fire it off and try to kill him. A tip is to wait for your creeps to kill his creeps. In the moment they push, launch your arrow and stun him. Finish him off with Leap and Starfall. If you're good, lucky and/or fast you'll eventually claim the First Blood rather quick. If you're laneing with a disabler, try to let him throw his stun first so you're making almost sure that your arrow will hit. This requires a bit timing though and you need to communicate with your mate to succesfully do this.<br/>Try to keep farming untill you're around level 6-7. Buy your Boots of Speed and a Bottle and start to look for opportunities to gank other lanes. Don't waste to much time roaming around in the river. Return to your original lane and if you see a good ganking lane, try to head off unnoticed and gank. When you've done so you ought to return to your lane again. Don't lose too much gold and experience trying to gank without succeeding. Eventually just kill your lane opponent(s) instead. Keep a constant flow between farming and ganking without roaming too much. Don't farm all your game away. Mirana's capability is too high to just stand passively and farm. But you also need items later so don't spend 5 minutes in the woods waiting for someone to arrive and kill. It may take a few games practice to get a good grip of when to farm and when to gank and also how to do it. Eventually you'll get the idea rather fast.", "Middle game will basically be the same as the early game to you. Like before, try to keep a constant flow between farming and ganking. Follow your team mates' gameplay and try to follow them in ganks. If there are any big fights going on, try to stay in the background throwing your Starfall and saving your Elune's Arrow. If you see a low healthed hero escaping, try to get to the flank and shoot him. Else, try to farm empty lane or run around killing enemies. If you're doing well you can still kill most enemies alone.", "Actually, the late game will be pretty much the same drive as the early game. Follow your team mates in ganks and heavy pushes. Still try to stay in the background in fights dishing out damage. Help pushing and clearing creep waves with Starfall so you only need to worry about the heroes. Again, try to save your arrow for when someone low trys to escape. If you're against a strong initiation team (Warlock, Tidehunter, Magnataur, Earthshaker, Puck etc.) try to stay even further back than normal and the moment before the two fronts smash together (you need to learn to calculate this by practice too) activate Moonlight Shadow. Hopefully this'll make your enemies waste their aoe stuns and whatsoever and keep you and your allies safe in the invisibility form avoiding to get raped. Else just stand in the back and again just focus fire your enemies hoping to kill somebody. If the showdown turns out to your favour, you can Leap and aim for fleeing enemies.

In my opinion, the semi-carrier is a better use for Mirana, but sometimes, it's worth it to go Support. So, what do you need to check to make this decision? Basically you need to look your allies, especially in pubs, where everyone -random or simply pick without caring for what the team has. Sometimes you will find yourself with a extremely late-game team. Your team already has a Troll and a Mortred so in this case go for support. Sometimes the opposite will happen: there are no carriers, Mirana then is supposed to carry late game.", "The game begins and you picked/randomed PotM. First thing is choosing your lane. Mirana is a pretty good solo hero, but if there are any better heroes for the job (Tinker, Shadow fiend), you should leave the solo lane for them. Try harassing your enemies with normal attacks on the first few levels. At level three you are already able of killing someone. If the opportunity appears throw and arrow, and try killing them. The best time to do this is when your creeps just ended killing their creeps. If you're laned with a disabler wait for him to stun first, so you have 100% chance of hitting with your arrow. This, of course, will require some communication. Try last-hitting and denying until level 6-7. Until then you should have at least your Wand and Boots or Bottle. Your choice, I usually go with Bottle first, since you have leap you can keep up to your enemies but hey, your choice. At this point you should look for good ganking opportunities without wasting too much time without farming. Mirana is somewhat item-dependent late-game so try roaming as shortly as possible. But don't just stay AFK-farming either, as the game goes one your 2 damage skills lose their effectiveness.", "Almost the same as Early Game, try keep a balance between farming and ganking. If you see some allies are getting ganked don't hesitate on using Moonlight Shadow. Somewhere in this stage you should complete or almost complete your core. At this point, you can use use Starfall from times to times to farm and push.", "At this point of the game you should simply accompany your team in pushes or team battles. Use Moonlight Shadow for positioning or fleeing. Try keeping some distance and not getting to much attention. If your team is winning and you see some fleeing enemies, feel free to leap in and snatch a kill. Spam Starfall to farm and push, but in a much intensive way then in middle game.

Use your abilities wisely and try to deal as much dmg as you can with your Manta illusions and Adaptive Strike. Save Waveform if you are not sure if you will need it to escape or not. Always save for buyback. You should only spend your whole money if you are confident enough that the bought item will make a huge difference in team fights.", "Surfing Time", "dotafire", "http://www.dotafire.com/dota-2/guide/in7-gankers-guide-to-morphling-735", "Morphling", "1");

You can also harass with Death Pulse, just wait for melee heroes to go in for the deny and then use Death Pulse on them they will start getting worried and stop last-hitting.

Top (Sentinel) and bottom (Scourge) are very risky lanes because it’s easy to gank them.<br/>When you go with a mate, chose someone aggressive support like Vengeful Spirit because he doesn’t steal your lasthits and you can make some kills with him.

He is usually found near the rear of every team casting his heals and repels. The only time he should be found in the center would be when he initiates his Guardian Angel.<br/>Tanking and Initiating: He can get the job done but he isn't really meant to do either. He can tank but his supportive skills allows real tanks do their job more decently. And he can initiate but he can't initiate every clash making him unreliable. He shouldn't attract any attention to himself if possible so leave this jobs to the real tankers and initiators.<br/>Nuking: He has only one spell to be considered as a nuke. It has a small AoE but it can deal serious damage. But Purist's shouldn't be considered a nuker at all. His nuke is unreliable as it requires the target of the heal to be within melee range of the enemy in order to deal damage. Better used as a supportive skill rather than a nuke.<br/>Ganking: The Omniknight is capable of initiating a gank simply by walking up to the target and slowing with degen aura, whacking them with his hammer and purifying himself to kill the target but he can't quite get the job done flawlessly. The lack of a disable means his targets can simply TP away before Omniknight can even deal a significant amount of damage. Overall he can gank to a certain extent.<br/>Roaming, Carrying and Disabling : These roles are not even close to how Purist operates. He fails epically at roaming and at disabling he needs to get Euls or Guisoo to have a decent disable. And he can't carry as effective as 'real' carries, he's not even at par with semi-carries.", "So three lanes to choose from. Short, Mid and Long lanes. You do better at the side lanes where you can build up your Soul Ring easily and where you can baby sit one of the carries.<br/>Purification or Repel: So there will be situations where you ally or you have sustained enough damage from physical harassment and the enemy is about to launch a full scale skill fiesta. So the first to your should consider is does your carry/yourself sustained more than 50% HP loss? If yes then purification first, then repel afterward if your mana can handle it. If no then just cast Repel and maybe you and your lane mate can harass the enemy back.<br/>Get boots first<br/>Proceed to build up and comeplete Soul Ring<br/>Continue farming and protecting your lane mate", "Start particpating in small clashes<br/>Build up your next item begin with the mana regen always<br/>Push some towers and keep your carry safe<br/>Ganking: Basically all you do is, cast Repel on the ganker/nuker/carry. <br/>Purify whoever is taking the most damage from the enemy or heal to seal the frag if you think your team can't get the frag fast enough.<br/>And always try to be in melee range of the target hero. Your slow still plays an important role in ganking. Just don't push your luck.<br/>Use Guardian Angel only when you think you can get two or more kills or if your team could be counter ganked. Otherwise don't use it.", "Force clashes whenever GA is up<br/>Push those towers<br/> Clashes: This is where the Omniknight truly shines. So before a clash ever commences make it a habbit you cast Repel on your teams carry/initiator and always use SR before casting a skill to conserve mana. Once a clash has been initiated begin to purify your damaged or dying allies. Don't ever wait for moments where you can damage an enemy at the same time. Heal as soon as possible but be wise on who to heal. Whenever Repel's cd is over cast it back on your teams carry or a hero with a strong channeling spell(i.e. Rylai, Voljin). And always cast Repel on your allies that are vulnerable to a single nuke before death. Now about Guardian Angel. Before casting always be at the center of the team so that all or most of the team receives the buff.

Try to get your Arcane Ring early, when you got it, it will be really boost to you. You can heal without worrying the mana.

Don’t use it too early, it will make your opponent retreat until your Angel vanished. And the most important thing, don’t wait until your friends die, or even you! When trying to defend an outer tower, you will need to stay behind the tower and waiting for the best opportunity to initiate.

      VALUES ("Omniknight..imo one of the best support heroes in dota allstars. Support heroes are treasured in team plays. However, being a 'support' hero has its negative connotations. You might say that support heroes don't usually get kills. Hopefully, this guide will help you become a hero-killer aside from doing your usual 'supporting-role' job in a 2-2 up to a 5-5 game. Omniknight has been my favorite hero in dota in the past month or so but this is my first time actually writing a strat for him..hehe. Omnknight's importance as a support hero does not only depend on his items, but rather on the user's ability to spot dying or low HP teamates in a 'harapan' situation wherein all 10 heroes from both teams are facing each other in a single area. I understand the importance of having a huge mana pool and regen to be able to help your teammates. However, I find plain 'supporting' boring..hopefully with this strat, you will be able to enjoy killing your enemies as well. Remember: Omnknight, like anti-mage, is a very good hero to use against INT heroes. Here goes..", "Farm fast, Omniknight has a relatively high base damage and is good for making last hits. Do not choose the middle lane.<br/>When you are facing ranged heroes/nukers, stay behind your creeps and hold the alt button and make the last hit on dying creeps. Continue doing this until you have lvl 4 of purification. As for melee heroes, go straight to hitting enemy creeps while hold the alt button to watch for dying creeps.<br/>If the melee hero tries to harras you, let him hit you 1-2 times to get your creeps' attention, and after that hit him back. He'll be losing a lot of HP more than you now and will try to run back to his tower. If you already have at least lvl 2 of degen aura, he won't be able to run far. You'll be able to kill him doing normal attacks, or you could outrun and go ahead of him a bit without hitting him, then use purification on yourself. First blood ;) If the melee hero you are facing has a disabling/stunning skill, most likely he will use it when you have a low HP. It is important for you to use purification at once when you have 1/2 of your HP left if your opponent does not run away(he is obviously planning to disable you).", "Team battle support: This is the part where most hero-killings start and teams start packing up the middle lane. Your support skills will be great greatly valued from this point on. In a team battle situation, hold the alt button to check your allies's HP, once you see one having less than half of his HP and being targeted by the enemy, heal him at once. Purification has a long casting range. Prioritize on allies in that kind of situation. Do not pay attention to those insisting on being healed especially during a team-battle unless they are in that situation. Tell them you are not a walking fountain of health and that you need to use your mana/spells wisely. Use your guardian angel to push through towers that have been damaged to half it's HP and also, in team battles. Do not use guardian angel at once when a team battle just begins...your opponents will only back off until the guardian angel wears off..it will be rendered useless. Use in the middle of the battle, when the enemy starts to think they can kill one of your team members. You will eventually become a natural at this if you frequently use omniknight in a game", "You will still use the same strategy for team battle situations in the early-middle game strat. Watch out for low-HP allies and heal them, use GA properly. When you have MKB formed, not only are you a very important support hero, but you become a hero-killer as well. In early-middle game, your allies will usually get the kills in team battle situations. But now, you are now an uber killer yourself. If you see an enemy hero going solo in a lane farming (watch out from ambushes, not that you can't esace from it), you can just put repel on and kill that hero easily. Make sure your GA is always ready though before you go out solo-killing. If ever it is an ambush, you can easily escape because of your high movespeed and area-slowing ability, coupled with spell invulnerabilty. They can't disable, stun, or simply run after you. If it happens to be a 5-1 gangbang with enemy slowers, you can cast GA while having repel on and you are practically invulnerable. you can run away or teleport using a scroll of town portal. If you already have satanic and the gangbangers don't have a slower with them, you can even kill one of them before running away..you are practically invincible anyway and once your GA wears off , you'd still be getting around 30 hp per hit from the lifesteal as well as healing yourself. But I don't advise that though, especially if there are more than 3 enemy heroes involved..unless you really think you're an uber pro..heh.", "ninong's guide to the Omniknight", "dotastrategy", "http://www.dotastrategy.com/strategy-328-PuristThunderwrathninongsguidetotheOmniknight.html?sid=ae0202d4b100e51e67aa2746a3535961", "Omniknight", "60");

His deadly Arcane Orb enhances his attacks with large amounts of unresistable pure damage, and if his mana pool gets high enough the Obsidian Destroyer is capable of killing fragile enemies with only a few Arcane Orb attacks. Astral Prison is a useful ability, which can put a powerful enemy hero out of the fight or save an ally from death. In addition, it drains intelligence when cast on an enemy hero, and by repeatedly using this ability the Obsidian Destroyer can quickly reduce the enemies' mana pool, making it difficult for them to cast many spells. To keep both his own and his allies' mana pools full, the Obsidian Destroyer has a passive skill called Essence Aura. In addition to boosting the Destroyer's own mana pool, this aura gives any allied unit under its effect a chance to instantly regain a portion of their total mana pool every time they cast a spell. Essence Aura fuels Arcane Orb, giving the Destroyer potent damage with little risk of running dry. Although Arcane Orb and Astral Prison make the Destroyer deadly in small engagements, his powerful Sanity's Eclipse spell can turn the tide of large battles. An Obsidian Destroyer with a lot of intelligence items can kill or badly wound several enemy heroes at once with this spell. Few heroes are capable of putting out as much damage as a pumped up Obsidian Destroyer.", "In the early game, it's important you get a good start. Grab as many last hit as you can and harass with Astral Imprisonment, which will boost your base damage. If you're levelling Arcane Orb, make sure you don't waste it because 100 mana for a missed last hit is a BIG waste. By the time you hit level 8, if you're going for an Orchid, you should at least have finished an Oblivion Staff and made a start on either a Force Staff or Eul's Scepter.", "By the time you hit level 11, you would be in good shape to have finished a second Oblivion Staff. You need to farm a fair bit, so take the lane that you think you'll be able to take. If the rest of your team take a lane, that might take the fire away from you because the other team has been forced to defend. Make sure you keep note of how many enemy heroes are defending, though, because there could be a few on their way to gank you. Once you reach level 16, you ought to be close to finishing your Orchid or have 2 of the 3 items used in Sheepstick. With spare gold you should build your Force Staff or Eul's.", "Getting into the late game you need to finish your core items so you can take part of big team pushes and ganks, since if you have been properly farmed, you'll be a monster with close to +200 pure damage.

Once the two lines clash, begin decimating their casters. Usually, they won’t have time to react before you're all over the place thanks to your images.

      VALUES ("Where the butcher at?", "Ok, so you picked Pudge. What now ? As Pudge I extremely recommend taking the Solo Lane, mid or the safe lane, bottom for the Radiant or Top for the Dire. Pudge is one of these solo heroes who are very level dependant in order to be effective in the early game. Tangoes, a Salve, 2 Gauntlets and 2 Branches in my opinion are the best items you could go for because it gives you decent stats to lasthit and enough regen for the early game. Also, the Bauntlets can be build in an Urn of Shadows later. If you expect hard harrass coming out from your lane opponent (e.g. Sniper) and the enemy team has 3 or more physical damage dealers, you can also change the 2 Gauntlets for a Stout Shout shield. Another option is the Quelling Blade, which gives you even more lasthitting power (highly recommended against SF) and the possibility to cut trees to Hook you enemies into angles where they can't flee. Rejected item to leave base with: Naked Bottle  ; I say this is the worst possible item you could go for when leaving base: Bottle first. Here are two reasons why:   1. Bottle gives you no stats to increase your lasthitting damage, just 3 charges, which corresponds 405 hp and 210 mana you can get from. Which doesn't  sound bad at all, but it is, because it leads to  2.  If your team didn't buy a courier with that you can refill your Bottle or you are playing against a hero which can out-rune you like QoP you are pretty fucked, because if you have to go back to base due to low hp and mana, you miss exp. and gold.", "When you are lvl. 7 you MUST start ganking, otherwise you would waste your early killer potential. By this point, when the night begins, you should at least have your Boots of Speed and your Bottle. If you've done well with lasthitting in the lane you can get an Urn of Shadows additionally. Get the items in your stash and then - start ganking the SHIT out of your enemies (keep in mind to buy a Smoke of Deceit if you think the enemy supporter has bought Wards to see you coming for a gank) ! You should never stay in your lane lasthitting creeps after you have reached lvl 7. A good start is to trying to kill your lane opponent if he is still in your range of vision. Because the sight range of the most heroes in Dota is decreased by 1000 (!) at night, you can easily hide inside the river where he can't see you and wait for a good Hook. Afterwards you should gank the sidelanes where usually their hardcarry farms. Try to get every rune from minute 6:00 on (6:00--8:00--10:00-...)", "In terms of the gameplay, I don't think I have to say that much for this section of the game.

      VALUES ("Tips and Tricks", "Here a few Tips & Tricks for the Early Game: 1. Let your supporter get the wards and the courier if possible. Pudge needs the gold more. 2. Always go for a solo lane (unless playing with a special lane ally called Techies) preferably mid to reach the side lanes for ganks more easily, take Rot at lvl. 1 because the slow % stays the same and the lvl. 1 Hook range isn't really worth it. 3. Most important thing to keep in mind : You are LEVEL DEPENDANT, not necessarily item dependent ! So play safe and avoid  dying until lvl 6/7 ! 4. Try to have at least your Bottle, Boots and be lvl. 7 when the night begins ! If you have a lane opponent who harasses you very hard you can also hook creeps and go close to them, then try to kill them with Rot and a right-click, then fall back 5. If you're the superior in your lane and you think you can kill him, try to hook your lane opponent when you're on the high ground near your own tower,  then Rot him to death (avoid clicking directly on the enemy hero when you're doing this, otherwise you will draw creep aggro !) 6. Start roaming at the latest from lvl 7 on; always max Hook first and try to kill their hard/semi-carries as often as possible ! 7. I recommend to skip every rune till the min. 6 rune, because if your lane opponent goes for it, you will have free lasthits and exp. Also don't forget to do a good creep-block at the beginning. 8. Always carry a TP with you,either to teleport to a lane to gank quickly or to escape if you think the enemies might gank you! ", "Tips for successful ganking: <br/>1. Hide inside the trees and the Fog of War <br/>2. Study the enemy's movements and predict where they will go next. Then hook them ! One important fact for landing a good hook : You can't move AND attack at the same time ! Use this to your advantage, observe the intervals between their movement and the attack animation, then hook ! <br/>3. Because most of the people tend to 'hug' their lane creeps when playing against Pudge to reduce the risk of being hooked you should hook a bit left or right to the spot where the enemy hero and the creep stand. In most cases, this will grant you a successful Hook, because the hero models are bigger than the creep models. <br/>4. By writing dota_range_display xxx in the console you can create a green circle around your hero. In Pudge's case, you can then see the Hook AoE permenantely; to manage this, write dota_range_display xxx depending on the current level of the Hook in your console (to activate the console go to your Steam games -> Dota 2 -> properties -> set starting options -> type  in -console -> start Dota 2) 'dota_range_display 725' is equal to Hook range lvl. 1, 'dota_range_display 925' to Hook range  lvl. 2, ... 1125 to lvl. 3 and dota_range_display 1325 to lvl. 4. This can really help you landing good Hooks because it shows you the range continuously.  ", "In terms of the gameplay, I don't think I have to say that much for this section of the game.

Remember, taking towers quickly provides far more money than farming creeps, and can give you the item advantage that allows you to break the enemy base. During battles you should be able to feed on enemy spellcasters by zapping them with Nether Ward. It's a win/win situation - if they use spells to fight, they die to Mana Flare. If they choose to spend time stalling until they find the ward and kill it, your team will run over the top of them with your own offensive skills. Always look to save allied heroes with your Mekansm and/or Decrepify. Never ever Decrepify a hero that your team is killing with physical damage. Think quickly and choose your targets well. Poogles is weak as hell so you'll need your wits about you to survive battles. ", "Sure, you've lost a bit of power but you've still got some tricks up your sleeve. Screw over the enemy damage dealers with Decrepify and continue to take down towers with Nether Blast. Your ward is still a frighteningly strong spell - particularly because enemy ultimates now cost upward of 400 mana.

Though, if you have maxed out nether wards you can almost push the lanes uncontested, because almost all engagements from the enemies should require abilities to be casted, or they will just straight out lose the team fight. With a well placed nether ward the enemy team will be punished for even attempting to engage on Pugna and his team while they are pounding away on the tower. When they engage, just spam your nether blast, decrepify, and life drain on them while your nether ward zaps them to bits.", "If you still havent ended the game by now, you better pray you have a carry on your team because all of Pugna's abilities become far less effective during the late game.

If you have a stronger level dependent ganker in your team and you think your team will actually need the ganks, then I suggest you let him take mid. Watch how the creepwave is positioned and the number of creeps of each side, do not engage when the enemy has more allied creeps with him than you, he's still Static Linkable in those situations but do not attack him or you will attract creep agro on yourself, either wait for your creeps to join in so that they may get some heat off you or, if he runs back, follow him a bit and then once your are out of the range of his creeps agro, hit him a couple of times. Be careful to what type of heroes you do this to, the tide can turn just as easily if he has allies around or skills that work well on isolated targets. Do not take unnecessary risks. If you can be aggressive, be aggressive otherwise stay defensive, focus strictly on last-hitting and wait for the enemy to make mistakes, once he does, make him pay. As soon as you have your Phase Boots you can you can go gank if you are really required on one of the sidelanes and you are sure to net some kills but if the lanes are fine then continue farming, keep a Healing Salve and a Town Portal Scroll in your inventory and focus on counterganks. If you do get some good runes early game, you may attempt some early ganks but make sure the lane you are ganking has enough disables/damage to actually get those kills.", "If you had a bad early game you're probably standing just on a Phase Boots, do not go out ganking like this, you are probably under-leveled and definitely underfarmed. Focus on getting that Vitality Booster as soon as you can and take no risks, countergank only, tp in when you think you can make a difference, otherwise don't waste your time, you are probably already in bad shape anyway. Perhaps you should put more points into that Unstable Current instead of Static Link if you are getting focused down fast, this is for you to decide. Once your get that Vitality Booster you can act a bit more cocky and maybe pull out some ganks, if you are unsuccessful in your ganks then the enemy is probably already in better shape than your team, or you ganked a ungankable lane where you don't have allies that are prepared for your ganks (no stuns, slows or nukes). Direct your attention to farming that Vanguard and keep safe if so. If you had a good early game you probably already have your core items at this stage of the game, this is when Razor turns into a mighty beast. Proceed to gank kill-able lanes. Have your allies start off with a disable while you are nuking the enemy with Plasma Field from the fog of war, tag one of them with Static Link and stay close while getting in some cheap shots, don't forget to have activated your Eye of the Storm beforehand. You should easily dispose of one enemy with your autoatacks, if his ally sticks around, then you can probably focus him down in more or less 5 attacks with the huge damage boost from Static Link and maybe a Plasma Field to finish him off. If the lane is pushed and you have creeps at the enemy tower use this opportunity to inflict some heavy damage on it with your autoattacks, perhaps even get a tower out of this if your allies can help you. Maintain some between farming and ganking while emphasizing on ganking and pushing.", "If for some reason you were unable to finish it in mid-game then there's probably a unforeseen strategy that the enemy has been using to keep you away from their towers. Things get difficult for Razor at this stage of the game if he had a really bad start. Reaching lategame means you are bound to meet the enemy carries face to face. If you had a bad early game, you are probably easy to take out, so remain hidden in the fog of war before teamfights, you are still somewhat effective at this stage though even if underfarmed, getting big on Static Link can still turn the tide of a battle, as long as you remain unnoticed. It's best Static Linking isolated enemies if you want to keep a low profile. You are probably best getting your damage from the enemy supports/tanks rather than the carries if you are in this type of situation, instead of neutralizing the enemy carry will should be mostly focusing on just killing the supports as fast as you can and then start giving the carry some hell with the damage that you got from his supports, all this while striving to remain alive. Spam your Plasma Field as often as possible. If you had a good early-game you are probably very hard to take out for the enemy team and also a main target. You can afford to take the front-lines in these situations if nobody else is capable of handling the damage, and your allies support it (acting as bait for strong allied initiation, lots of supports/stuns). Instead of Static Linking the supports/tanks you should be trying to get to the enemy carry and start sapping away his damage, be careful though, in lategame things are very different from early-mid-game. Damage is high at this stage of the game and you can be focused down, it's a bit tricky but you need to have good timing when you start sapping away damage, if he can nearly kill you if he focuses then maybe you should wait first until the enemy carry commits to a fight with one of your allies, then Static Link him and make him regret his choice. If the enemy carry is kept safe inside his team then you need to fight a way to split them up, this is usually achieved by baiting and getting the team in uncomfortable positions. You can easily bait or send a support to do it and then have your team come from the sides or behind and strike at their weakest links (the squishy guys).", "Carry Mid", "dotafire", "http://www.dotafire.com/dota-2/guide/razor-path-of-least-resistance-632", "Razor", "1");

This can of 3 things:  1) Press ‘A’, with the left mouse button on a specific enemy unit. 2) Press ‘A’, with the left mouse button on the floor. 3) Right-click on a specific enemy unit.  If your handheld is idle and an enemy is in its coverage and your hero starts to attack, which is an acquired auto-attack, the cause never Maelstrom. Note that for scenatios 1 and 3 when the unit dies, your hero goes into neutral again, so it is best to quickly remake another attack command (or shift-queue it).  Agriculture-Due to recent changes in BoT earlier and earlier, both farm building faster and easier. Just look for great enemy creeps and teleport to a safe allied creep there. It is advisable to have a plasma field to use for the creeps faster agriculture. A little bit of pressure can be good. Do not press too deeply into this point of time.

After you have bot teleport to expect to defend and enforce. The real aggression to be when you got your EoS, that they have higher hp, agi and slow. Have fun!  Mjollnir Farming This technique should be used only when there are no enemies nearby and you are heading home after this defense. Use this when it crawls a large number of enemy. Use static charge on the tank itself and goose bumps. Plasma Field and normal beat. With the constant charging and your plasma field, you should take a position in which the wave very quickly.  Pushing Pushing should be very fast at this point. With agriculture + BoT Mjollnir track you to track in a very short time to push. Just be careful because the ganks although you may not be too fragile, still lacks an escape mechanism when you are alone. So it would be better to push with an ally or two.  Team Battles It should be much more active in team battles because of their much higher HP and damage. Space charge on your tank and hit as much as possible. You can even tank a bit on yourself when you have confidence in hitting the opponent. Remember, not at this point long ago.

This part of the game is when Razor really starts to shine. Do NOT waste time farming like a hard carry at this point, participate in pushes and ganks. With Vanguard and Link you can even take on some heroes after you dive into their tower. Pushes and kills give you money anyway, and Razor is really good at getting kills, since Eye of the Storm automatically targets the lowest hp target, and because of your chasing ability, x-ray vision and constant source of damage. <br/>If you are doing well, the opponents will surely be wary of you at this point, and will try to take you down as fast as possible. Ideally you should have your Blademail at this point to counter their focus fire. In team fights be aggressive, on your ulti and try to absorb as much damage as possible while remaining alive, spamming your nuke whenever it cools and phasing away as soon as you're in danger of dying.

You will need more then you core if you want to be effective late, however. This time you must pick your items wisely and in accordance to the enemy.

Manual Glaives makes the tower ignore you! In any case you are able to farm a Mekansm quickly, feel free to use it when you have lost 300 HP or so.

You should aim to buy a Eul's Sceptre of Divinity now. You will firstly purchase a Void Stone, then a Staff of Wizardry, then a Robe of Magi then the recipe paper. After you grab a Void Stone, you then have the luxury to leave Glaives of Wisdom on auto cast, but remember when it is in auto cast you are still complied to last hit/orb walk, so mana is not wasted whilst auto attacking. In doing so, you now can use the hotkey 'A' rather than 'W' to use Glaives of Wisdom. Thereby I assume when you have a Void Stone or a Eul's Sceptre of Divinity, you will not be auto hitting. Your Eul's Sceptre of Divinity is your escape device. You can use it to escape, save allies, gank and chase fast move speed enemies.<br/>Once you have your Mekansm and Eul's Sceptre of Divinity you can consider pushing, as it is now safe and effective. Whilst pushing, tell your allies beforehand that you will ensure their safety with Global Silence. You hold a very important responsibility; healing your allies, cycloning the correct hero in the correct time, and using your ultimate in the right time. You may also want to stay relatively close to the main battle, so the aura Last Word will trigger. You will also be Glaiving the enemies, tearing them into pieces with your now, high DPS. If the opposition recognize you as a big threat, you may become their primary target, and also note that you are still fragile, so you are to stay relatively close to your allies (not in the front line where you will get nuked) to heal, support while dealing massive amount of damage.

If this is the case, you cannot be prejudiced against him/her, but play in their style, by rambo pushing.

Silencer is a hero that doesn't have much room for creativity so you won't be seeing something unique here. Take note this is a BATTLE SILENCER.", "First start off with 2 tangooes and 2 circlets and head out to the mid lane(sacrifice a circlet if your the one assigned to buy the chicken for the team.). Silencer must solo he needs the extra experience and gold to be effective mid to late game. When in your lane you should last hit, deny, and farm like your life depended on it. Be aggressive, and harass often with Glaives. It's called 'orb-walk' (see the orb walking section for a more detailed explanation) you press 'W' and left click the enemy hero to cast a single glaive on him in order to harass him. You might wonder, 'What's the point of this it does so little damage anyway', The damage will add up if you repeatedly harass the hero like this. The reason why Glaives is such a powerful harassing too is because creeps will not attack you if you harass a hero by manual casting it. Normally if you attempt to attack a hero the creeps will focus their attention on you but if Glaives was manual casted, it is counted as a spell therefore it will not trigger creep aggression. Early game is all about lane control for Silencer, I suggest you rush Dagon at this point to make the most out of it. If your dominating in lane control turn your circlets into Nulls but if your having a hard time I suggest you turn them into Bracers. Once you hit Level 7 your Glaives have a 0 cooldown, abuse it by Orb-walking like no tomorrow.", "Your Mid game performance greatly depends on your early game. If you completed your dagon then I suggest making the most out of it by Kill stealing as often as you can. That's right! I want you to Kill Steal, unlike all the other heroes silencer benefits alot more from getting a kill since every kill will give him 1 more int. If you are completely against kill stealing your Dagon still has another purpose to fulfill. Although Orb walking helps you kill running heroes, you can't expect to orb walk every hero to death, Dagon is used as a finisher in case if they survive your orb walk. By now I suggest you start farming for an Eul's, It helps alot in getting him out of sticky situations since silencer doesn't have a natural escape mechanism. Remember you should still be orb-walking when ever you engage an enemy hero don't neglect it.", "There are 2 possible outcomes once you hit late game. If you have been doing poorly early - mid, your going to be food. However if yo had been scoring alot of early to mid game kills, you'll be a late game monster. Work on your Guinsoo since your Eul's charges would problably be used up by now. Here you should use global silence for the team either to stop a channeling spell or to give your team a free 5 second BKB. Keep your glaives Auto-casted now since you have plenty of mana to spare, in team clashes your role is the DPS hero, your unreduced damage glaives can rip apart high armored AGI heroes and your last word can prevent them from using chain nukes. By now it's ok to sell the Dagon in order for you to buy survivability items such as a Heart.

Keep in mind your objectives early: Farm last hits and Don't Die. Your hero is not a great early ganker or chaser, which means that you have to harass your enemy in your lane. Try to get early lane control by harassing with glaives and using curse to keep their mana depleted (if going with the curse build).<br/>In the beginning, get your start items and choose your lane. This should be mid or the long lane (bottom for sentinel, top for scourge) because of your lack of movement speed (290) which is very low and means you'll be an easy target for a gank in the short lane. Solo-lane is nice, but not essential.<br/>Hug the tower until level 3, while harassing with glaives and last hitting/denying as much as possible to get your farm rolling.<br/>Once you've reached level 3, start to curse and try to curse both of your enemys with the new 350 AoE of this spell. If you're up against the proper opponents, they'll have quite a problem with saving their mana for harassment or a gank (Remember: Chose your build based on your opponents, don't use the CotS build against spell spammers). Once your harass gets going you should have fairly good lane control and should be fairly safe.Now is the time to Farm, Farm, Farm! Get kills if possible and constantly use curse to terminate your opponents mana, remembering that if he has no more mana, he will take the full 400 dmg aswell which makes the curse very dangerous! You will also cause some opponent to leave the lane cause of low hp/mana", "During the midgame you shoud carry TP scrolls with you at all times, to prevent ganks as well as quickly come in to participate in them.<br/>(another tip: if you're getting ganked, you may use Global Silence right before using TP scroll to prevent the opponets using stuns while you are teleporting)<br/>Scale back your usage of CotS, as now many heros have spammable active items like Phase Boots, Arcane Ring, and Armlet, which cancles our curse after use. This won't be a problem, however, if the early game went well, as you should have a stable farm and are ready to face your opponents in litte team battles, provided you picked up some survivability in items like Str Treads or Bracers.<br/>Although your behavior now should be like the guys of FC Liverpool, 'Never Walk Alone!' this is very important, bacause you still have low survivability compared to many other heroes. Just farm (but dont go too far, you are an easy target solo) or join your friends ganks. Your Glaives and Hex will be a really nice damage/disable burst. Do this until lategame, get the rest of your core items and your items of further choice.<br/>Until now, its enough to use Global Silence to save your teams heros when they are getting ganked far away from you, as well as to initiate ganks of your own.", "Your role until the end of the game is to Gank, Farm or Teambattle.<br/>What ever you do, before the fight begins, do not allow yourself to be the first target.<br/>Stay behind your allies, only jumping into battle after the fight begins. Use Global Silence as close to the initiation phase of the fight as possible, ensuring your opponents cannot gain an early advantage in the fight by chain-disabling. With the 5 seconds of spell negation GS provides, your team should have no trouble focusing down one or two of your opponents, making for uneven teams that will allow you to push down some rax. Remember that you're not done after using GS; hex the opposing carry as quickly as possible, and use Orchids on their strongest disabler after GS has run its duration. Your DPS should also be quite high now, so Glaive away, focusing on the low hp heroes and those heroes that will get away easily (blinking heroes) once the duration of GS is up.<br/>Note that the timing of Silence in Teambattles is very important.<br/>If the other team has AoE heros like Enigma, Sandking or Rylai, keep it until they get in position to cast ultimate, and then silence...<br/>Your team will destroy that hero, as they have to take position in middle of your own team, but they will be helpless without their spells.

You can still be the team tank, but you can also have a lot of fun.<br/>My sole philosophy regarding tanking is this: if you become too big, then the other side simply won't attack you and instead concentrate on your weaker team-mates - and when this happens, you have let your side down. This is why this guide almost totally omits pure tanking items: the objective is to get them to focus on you - but if you have to do it by killing everything you can, all the better for you.", "Radiant: Top Lane, Dire: Bottom Lane. If you are getting the Ring of Health to start, you have to be there (at one of the side ones) when the creeps spawn in order to afford it, so that denotes going Top or Bot (good, because going Mid is suicidal for Leoric anyway). However, if you're near the main Secret Shop in addition to a side one, you can also finish your Perseverance early without losing major experience, and stay in your lane a while longer.<br/>Leoric harasses by using the one thing he has in abundance: pure striking power. Only applicable if you can out-harass your enemies, such as one range, one melee, or two melees. Not applicable against two range, unless they are being stupid. If you are in the aforementioned lane situations, just steer clear of them and level for a while; if you have a ranged allied lane-mate, have him cover you.<br/>Do not spam Hellfire Blast! I can not stress this enough, do not use this unless you really have to. Your mana constraints at this point are extremely low.", "At this stage of the game, Leoric can walk into any but the Ancient creep camps, kill all of the creeps, and walk out again with full hitpoints and mana - since you have good regeneration, lifesteal, and don't need mana to creep. So farming is obviously very easy. If you want to farm in a lane, just be careful about enemies - have good map awareness and don't get ganked. If a single enemy comes... the chances are you can fight them, but thats in another section.<br/>Pushing: You are very tanky, so you can be the shield for your allies and/or creeps - make sure the tower attacks you instead of them, this is essential for both groups: shield your allies so they aren't damaged (you can deal with damage better than they can), and shield the creeps so they don't die and continue dealing damage to the tower.<br/>Killing heroes: Leoric is a simple hero when it comes to killing, since he can only do two things: use Hellfire Blast and attack.<br/>Ganking: Try to surprise them by coming out of the trees or fog, or from behind them. Use Hellfire Blast on the target immediately, cancel the silly 'I'm gonna stand here watching the fire thingy' animation and attack them as soon as the stun is launched. If they fight back rather than running, so much the better for you, because you have better lifesteal than they do (unless they got Satanic this early somehow, yea right). Keep attacking them until they flee, then just run behind them until Hellfire cools down and use that again. Rinse and repeat! The target will eventually die, provided you have decent mana regeneration.", "Battle Furies! When you get more than one of these, the splash damage increases. No diminishing returns or any of that annoying stuff, but pure addition. 35% each, so if you get three you do more damage to the enemies you aren't directly attacking. You run in, stun someone, attack them, watch their allies come to help... then you get a crit and do the helpers a ridiculous amount of damage from your multiple Furies, because theres nothing they can do about it besides not come that close (which means that you chew on their now-abandoned ally and then come for the others), or disable you a whole lot (for which you have bought a BKB I hope).<br/>", "Leoric Versus the World", "dotastrategy", "http://www.dotastrategy.com/strategy-10919-LeoricVersustheWorldbyShimrra3.html#earlygame", "Skeleton King", "65");

Most of the towers should have been destroyed already and only the Lv3 towers are left, so single hero pushes will not work. You need 3 or more allies, in order to mass push into the enemy base.

They may be hiding and waiting for a chance to initiate, or, it could be your team who is waiting to initiate. Heroes will start hiding behind the trees and then, when opportunity arises, one hero jumps out to attack another. Everybody who was hiding all comes out, resulting in a very messy battlefield, known as a clash. A clash is decisive of which team gets to push. A clash is ‘won’ when whichever team kills the most of or all of enemy heroes. Basically, when most enemy heroes are eliminated, it gives your team a breathing space to push without any interruptions, and that safety feeling as you will have close to no chance of getting killed until those death timers run out.

Crush is what allows him to initiate and gank and basically functions as your bread and butter throughout the game. It's also one of the best stuns in the game, lasting 2.5 seconds at all levels in an aoe around you. Already looking pretty good but it also boasts a ridiculous 8 second cooldown. This means that you can easily get multiple stuns off in a teamfight.", "Unless you have a melee hard carry on your team, you should ideally be going safe lane (top for dire, bot for radiant) with a ranged support, but you can go long lane too. Your sprint should let you escape most ganks if you see them coming early. Starting items generally include a shield, tangoes/salve, and hatchet to help you lasthit. Hatchet can easily be substituted for stat items like ironwood branches if you are confident in your lasthitting. Slardar needs farm to be effective, and ideally you would have priority over lasthits in your lane. Your first item should be ring of health, then boots of speed, then vanguard. You should finish your vanguard by 10 minutes. Even if you’re doing terribly on last-hitting, 10-12 minutes shouldn’t be too hard to aim for.", "So now you’ve gotten Vanguard and hopefully finished your treads. What next? Depends on the enemy composition, really. At this point you should get either blink dagger, more survivability, or more killing potential. BKB is essential in a large portion of the games you will play, as any team worth their salt will have at least some amount of CC so consider getting this next. As a bonus, activating BKB makes Slardar’s model really fucking huge, which is hilarious. However, if you don’t see it being necessary, consider getting blink dagger or a damage item next.<br/>Blink dagger is pretty situational, and I only really get it if our team doesn’t have a real initiator, but it’s a pretty solid item on Slardar all the same. You can easily catch people by surprise by blinking and crushing as opposed to sprinting towards them with 15% increased damage taken and giving them time to spread out. If you are looking for a damage item, Desolator is the way to go. Not only does it give you a bunch of damage, but it decreases armor, which stacks with your ult.", "One thing that I haven’t mentioned yet is Slardar’s ult. After you hit level 6, you should be casting this on everyone you see. It basically works as a mini double damage for your team on a single target and gives you true sight for a long time. How cool is that? It also has an absurdly low cooldown and low mana cost so this should be the first thing you cast on enemies before ganks/teamfights. Note that this also gives your crush more effective damage as it is physical and your amplify damage lowers armor. Even cooler. You should prioritize invis heroes to make them cry bitch tears.<br/>Teamfights are relatively straightforward; you basically just blink/sprint into battle with BKB on try to crush as many people as you can while casting your ult on cooldown and rightclicking shit. Basically you want to be in the middle of the fight and cause chaos while your carry rapes the enemy team. You have huge teamfight presence, so take advantage of that.", "It's a Crushmas Miracle", "dota2-builds", "http://www.dota2-builds.com/view-dota2-build.php?hero=Sladar&id=396", "Slardar", "60");

Mid game, you excel at finishing off escaping heroes anywhere on the map, and late game you are a tough to kill DPS hero. Unlike a lot of other carries, you create a unique AoE presence in team fights that shines with the right team composition. You're also slightly more versatile than other agility carries because  Dispersion allows you to be effective with HP items in situations where your team already has enough physical DPS.", "In the laning phase, focus on last hits until you can get Ring of Health and are level 6 or 7. At this point, you need some map awareness so you can  Haunt and finish someone off if your team needs your help. You can ask your team to ping when they may need your ult as well, but you should still make the decision on whether or not it's worth it since you won't be farming when you're ganking. If you can get at least 1 kill that your team wouldn't have otherwise, then it's a good idea. Also, the vision and minor damage from Haunt is sometimes enough and you don't need to use Reality + Dagger, allowing you to continue farming instead of jumping somewhere else. Avoid dying.", "Mid-game is basically an extension of the laning phase, where you should seek out farm and gank when it's worth it. By now you want to have  Radiance because bigger team fights will be happening and the burning aura will turn fights in your favor. Once you have  Diffusal Blade as well you should be getting at least 1 kill each time  Haunt is available, so let your team know if they are sitting around being boring when you're ready to go. Avoid dying.", "Hopefully by late game you have an advantage in terms of farm so you can start wiping out the other team and pushing down towers. Avoid dying while you can finish your items and keep up the map presence to scare your opponents into sitting around in base while you continue to farm.

You'll be a big target, so you'll need a buddy to help. There isn't any other way to farm except through last hitting, actually. I don't advise using dagger as a farming tool this early in the game especially since it's high mana cost and high cooldown might kill you later when you need it and can't access it. Since this is earlygame, it is highly unadvised to try to harrass an enemy with your high manacost dagger. Although, there will be cases where you'll have no choice. To harrass and farm at the same time, do what the earlier video showed, but making sure to aim at the hero and at the same time the dagger would pass through creeps. That way, the creeps are damaged/killed, and the enemy hero has been harrassed.

You'll be bound to find an ursa who is soloing rosh with this skill at least once. Trust me. Once you use haunt, you'll always see giant dots on the map, regardless of where they are. If you're going to gank with an ally, pick the one that is somewhat alone and somewhat close to your ally, if they aren't simply close to your ally and alone. If you have your diffusal however, you can gank heroes soloing your jungles, trying to take down rosh, loners who farm too far from their towers.

      VALUES ("Barathrum is a strong DPS hero with limited tanking capabilities. His main role in a team is DPS ganker and carry. His array of skills along with the right items make him a very dangerous hero in any one vs one situation. Barathrum's main advantage throughout the whole game is his high damage gained from Empowering Haste, and his permabashing capability from Greater Bash. It is important to make the most out of his huge damage and increase his DPS proficiency in the best way possible. SInce Barathrum already has a huge damage gain from his skills, it is more beneficial for him to buy IAS (Increase Attack Speed) items rather than damage items. <br/>Despite his huge damage advantage over other heroes, Barathrum's main weakness is his lack of AOE, range, or nuke of any sort. His early game can be very tough when laned against heroes with half-decent lane control. Barathrum is also very weak against nukes and disables. His potential to dish out massive amounts of damage make him a primary target for enemy disables, rendering him useless. For these reasons, Barathrum is almost never seen in leagues or professional play. So you may ask, 'Why should I pick Barathrum, when there are so many cons to his game?' Well the answer is, Barathrum has plenty of potential to be a DPS monster, especially in public play. When used right, Barathrum can be a very dangerous foe, and an unstoppable carry", "This is the part of the game when you are the most vulnerable. Since you don't have any range, nukes, harrassing skills or any AOE spells, your early game is going to be pretty brutal if your enemy knows what he is doing. It's very important at this stage that you stay away from danger and avoid being harrassed too much. Bring lots of regen consumables, and avoid being killed at all costs. If you are finding it hard to farm, then do a creep pull once in a while. Make sure that you do not get sent back to the fountain often because you really do need to level up fast to make the most of your gank potential.<br/>Learn to trigger creep aggro so you can get a clearer shot at the enemy creeps. You should almost always lane with a good babysitter, or an aggressive ally. Get the last hits and deny if you can. Assist in kills by using your Charge of Darkness to initiate and smash your enemies to death. Don't try to solo anyone if you think you might fail. If you happen to have come across a rune, abuse it and try to get First Blood. Haste synergizes very well with Empowering haste. Double Damage is very helpful as well. Invisibility should be given to an ally with a stun. Always pay attention to the minimap. Know when your enemies are missing and play it safe if you think they are coming to kill you. You don't have any reliable escape tools so the best method is to just avoid your gankers and tower hug. Remember, your main priority right now is to level up fast and farm for your items so that you can start ganking mid-game. If your early game performance is poor, chances are, it will handicap your mid game as well.", "This is the part of the game when you crawl out of your hole and starting getting into the action. Once you have your Bracers, Treads and MoM, you have the potential to solo gank lone heroes. Be cautious though, because at this point you are still very vulnerable to nukes and disables without a BKB. Heroes like Rhasta and Lion look weak and easy to kill, however they can unleash all their spells and kill you in an instant. Be wary during team battles because you are a primary target once you turn on your MoM.<br/>Ganking is the main part of Barathrum's mid game. Barathrum has potential to dish out massive amounts of damage while disabling the opponent at the same time with his Bash. Once you have your Mask of Madness, you will have sufficient IAS to permabash and kill most agility and intelligence heroes plus some strength heroes. You can manipulate Charge of Darkness by casting it from your fountain to a far away enemy. The mana regen from the fountain will refill your mana pool by the time you leave its regen range, thus you used no mana to cast your first charge. You should always ping your allies to let them know who you are charging, especially if you think you won't be able to kill the enemy by yourself.", "Late game is all about summing up how well you did in early and mid game. You reap the rewards of your earlier performance. For Barathrum, if you were able to gank successfully and got plenty of kills for your team, then late game should simply be wrapping it up. If you fed a lot and your opponents are much better farmed than you are, then your late game won't be as enjoyable. If you tried to gank a lot but left your opponent's carry to farm by himself for the whole game, then you will have a big problem to deal with.<br/>The most important aspect in late game is pushing. You win a game by destroying the opponent's Throne/Tree, simple enough. Most dota players tend to forget about the main objective and believe farming better items, or killing more heroes wins games. These two factors may play a huge role on deciding the winner, but the bottom line is: you win by pushing the enemy's towers. There are two general ways of pushing. One method is to simply go all out in one lane regardless of your enemy. This method is viable for heroes like Furion, Enigma, or Ezalor who actually can go all out in one lane because of their summons, or creep clearing skills. In this type of push, the enemy would not be able to counter push because they lack AOE damage and are overwhelmed by creeps or summons. While this method works to a limited degree of success, the second method is more practical. The second method is to gank and kill your opponents, then make a huge push that the opponent is very unlikely to recover from. This type of push fits Barathrum better because he is a ganker. Therefore, gank then push is the best way for Barathrum to finish a game.", "This ain't no milk cow", "dotastrategy", "http://www.dotastrategy.com/strategy-30967-ThisAintNoMilkCowAGuidebyDaMan2000.html", "Spirit Breaker", "80");

This is your bread and butter combo and should be used almost all the time. Be mindful with Vortex though, do not use it on a low hp hero.

Then you will have your Vortex for the other hero.", "how to teamfight: Storm's main purpose in fights is to jump in at the right moment and wreak havoc.

However, in team fights you should wait a little and let your allies initiate. Why? Because else you will get stunned. <br/>So jump in when the timing is right and try to use your main combo but also beware of what is happening around you.

Tinker can bring down his opponents almost always half hp all the time in his lane. He is very powerful early gamer, and should be played aggresively to take this early game advantage. Level up your Laser, and move on to your lane. Best lane is mid solo. Spam your laser. Even at level 1. It deals the exact amout of dmg it says on the tooltip 80/160/240/320. Spamming this will keep your opponent to play defensively, and cripple them from farming cos of the the % miss. You can spam this alot, since Tinker's starting mana pool is pretty high. Laser's casting range is 550, which is as far as your attack range but a little bit closer. So when using Laser, immediately attack your opponent straight after u laser while your still in your attack range. Do that by animation cancelling. Doing this will deal as much dmg as possible in ur lane.", "You now have Boots of Travel. Breathe a big sigh of relief. Even if the rest of the game goes badly for you, Boots of Travel alone means you will always be able to be helpful to your team no matter what happens. Ganking: This is your first priority. Being able to teleport anywhere around the map, you should keep a look out for an opportunity to gank heros. Especially heroes that are low in HP. You look for allies that can help you achieve a successful gank. Ask them to initiate the gank (slow or stun) when your TPing, then finish them off with your combo. When the gank is successful, and the battle is over, rearm and TP back to base. When you want to gank a low HP hero that think they are safely farming in a lane, TP to a creep where that enemy cannot see you. Then finish them off with your combo. Make use of your Rocket's range. Rocket's range is 2500. Which is very very LONG (about  2 screens). If you see an enemy that is extremely low in HP, don't hesitate to TP somewhere far away.

If they know that you are the biggest threat in the game then they will often focus you first (Which often happens to me when I play Tinker). So let the enemy focus your allies first by standing at the back of the group, and then moving into the battles last. Then while the enemy is aiming one of your allies, there's your chance to go in and help him out.<br/>COMBAT AGAINST MASS STUNS & DISABLES: Same method as above. Let your tank heros soak up the disables. When all stuns and disables have been used, thats your time to move in and do the damage. If they have too MANY stuns and disables, go for survivability items such as Linkens. BKB is an option if these stuns are really a big issue. (BKB cannot be rearmed).<br/>AGGRESSIVE PUSHER ENEMIES: When your enemy love to push all the time, keep repeating your defending method which is the MotM+Rocket combo. Since aggressive pushers always have massive creep waves with them, MotM will give you a ton of gold from that. Then when you have enough gold, go for a Shivas Guard for more AOE DMG. Then you can start outpushing your enemies by using Double-Shiva farm.

He offers unrivaled mobility by being able to teleport around the map with a 1-3 second cooldown which will always keep your enemies guessing where you will show up next. It will force your enemies to 2nd guess all their ganks because you can be there to help an ally in a couple seconds to unleash high burst damage that will easily turn a gank around. He can also effectively change most item cooldown to 1-3 seconds as long as he has mana which gives him great flexibility.", "Tinker has a pretty good early game and is one of the best solo mid characters. You should try to insist on getting solo mid because the faster you get your nukes leveled up the better off you and your teammates will be. At this point you should be focusing on last hitting to get your boots of travel as fast as possible and checking the runes every 2 minutes so you have mana to continue casting your spells. <br/>However, keep an eye out for people that drop below your instagib point and take them out. If you get a good ganking rune(haste or invis) then check the lanes and gank whoever the prime target is. Tinker has great burst damage with his 2 nukes so don't be shy about jumping in to help your teammates out.", "This is where things really start to get interesting for Tinker. He has the ability to teleport anywhere on the map at any time with rearm and boots of travel. You should keep your eyes open for any gank opportunities and any defense where your team needs help. Tinker is one of the few characters that goes straight for boots of travel which will make you faster and far more mobile than anyone else on the map so use this to your advantage.<br/>If nothing important is going on then just teleporting to an ally's lane to spam your spells and leave will make the enemies far less aggressive and easier on your teammates...plus setting them up for a later gank if they don't heal. And this will not really slow you down since you can teleport to the fountain and then back to your lane in no time. Don't be afraid to jump in and help an ally who is in trouble, your 564 burst damage out of nowhere can quickly turn a gank to your team's favor.<br/>At this point you turn into a pushing and farming fiend as well. With march of the machines leveled and your boots of travel you can teleport to farm/push any lane then be back where your team needs you very quickly. When teleporting to a lane cast your march of the machines, then use your bottle, and finally start rearming...this should all be done in a couple seconds and your bottle will regenerate your mana while you are rearming. Before using your BoTs to teleport out use the bottle again so you are constantly regenerating mana while channeling. If you use your bottle in this manner it will decrease the amount of time you need to stay at the fountain before teleporting out again.", "Tinker is one of the few int heroes whose power level does not cap at late game until his whole inventory is full of rearmable items. At this point tinker will likely have the highest creep score by a pretty large margin which is great because the more money he gets the more of a monster he turns into. The ability to permahex the enemy's carry or go all out spamming spells everywhere is crazy and will create a lot of confusion. At this stage you should have your first big item done and your 2nd item should be on its way to completion.<br/>At this point you should be able to take pretty much any character 1v1 without a problem. This means that when you are pushing the enemy team will have to dedicate at least 2 people to stopping you which gives the rest of your team an advantage to push or gank elsewhere. Performing your combo(laser,rocket,shivas) 2 times will deal 1427 damage(after resistances) to the enemy you are facing plus you will have 2 images beating on them while all of this happening.<br/>With his extremely fast pushing he can get a tower or rax down without the other team being able to react if they are not careful. He can wipe out a full creep wave regardless of the size in a matter of seconds and rush ahead to the next wave to annihilate that one as well. If you push to a tower and there are multiple enemies mia then just summon your images and let them beat on the tower while you teleport to safety. This will weaken the tower making it easier to take next time and tie up the enemies while you push or gank elsewhere.

You are just showing how insanely strong you are when you destroy their whole base alone... while backdoor regeneration is active.", "Buy a Stout Shield to reduce the amount of damage the enemy can do while you farm. You could also get a Ring of Protection instead, but I prefer the Stout Shield. Some cheap stats are always good and of course healing items are a must. After some farm you should buy a bottle so you can cast your spells more often. I would also suggest to go Solo Mid or Solo Bot, because you need as much experience as possible so you can kill enemies sooner.", "Arcane Boots are very good to stay on lane and to gank around the map. With the mana you will never have to go back to the base (for mana). Blink Dagger is a must on Tiny. A Tiny without dagger is a weak tiny and doesn't use the full potential of the hero. With an early Dagger you can Insta-kill almost every Agility or Intelligence hero in the game. But wait. Your skills scale late game, but they still cap at some point, so the next best item is Aghanims Scepter. It gives you enourmous damage with the cleave and range. It also makes Tiny one of the fastest Tower pushers in the game. Sadly Tiny has very low Attack Speed due his low agility and his ultimate. That's why you have to buy a Mask of Madness. It gives the most attack speed for the gold which makes it the best item after you get Aghanims.", "Attack speed, and more attack speed. Tha's what Tiny truely needs. That's why Mjolnir and Assault Cuirass are extremely good items. Mjolnir gives a lot of Attack Speed, almost as much as Mask of Madness, and it also gives you a nice mini AoE nuke in fights which adds to your cleave you get from Aghanims. Assasult Curiass on the other Hand gives you good Armor, but its also the only benefit yout get by finishing your Hyperstone. So basically Butterfly is much better for your defense than Cuirass and it also gives 5 attack speed more, damage and evasion. I would go for pure Life items like Heart or Bloodstone because you already have a lot of life due to your high STR gain, and other items benefit you more. For example a Black King Bar can win you the game. You can destroy one tower and two barracks when you activate your Black King Bar (unless your enemy deals insane physical damage). Deadalus is also pretty neat on Tiny because of his Cleave and the lifesteal, but you will hit very slow when you dont have other items like Butterfly, AC or Mjolnir first.", "GentlemanDota presents Tiny", "dota2-builds", "http://www.dota2-builds.com/view-dota2-build.php?hero=Tiny&id=337", "Tiny", "90");

A weird behavior between Avalanche and Toss allowed absurd nuking damage and instead of fixing this, it was declared official and hard coded into the interaction.

If you put Tiny on a dual lane a ranged hero is preferred to harass the enemy so you can deliver the final blow with your nukes. Furthermore it needs to be a point-click stun (or slow) so the combo can be started without problems of aiming or similar stuff. <br/>Solo laning: Soloing with Tiny means in almost every case soloing mid, because the only reason we're able to do this are RUNES. Runecontrol is essential to every solo Tiny, since all your ganking and surviving runs on the free bottle-charges of the runes. Bottle gets highest priority, if you must buy a pack of Observer Wards yourself so you'll be the first to snatch the runes.<br/>Most likely you'll be meeting a strong ranged solo hero (PotM, Nevermore, Viper, Tinker, you name it) which will give you a hard time, but don't despair. Your nukes are awesome and a Nevermore won't be smiling that much after getting the third Toss on his head. If you happen to meet a melee hero there, be agressive as hell.

You don't have that much mana, so you can't allow yourself too much failure so bring allies to help you. The enemies carries are your main target, but surely everything that dies will do it.

Don't get me wrong, 1,2k nuke damage still hurts, but it's not fatal to a carry hero with 2k hp anymore. They'll start hanging around together or be in range so that small gangs can turn fast into big teamfights. Depending on your team you can have two tasks now:<br/>1. Initiator. Tiny isn't the greatest initator in the world, but he'll do the job. Toss-Swap somebody out if you can or just dump your nukes and AoE stun on the head of 3+ heroes and hope that your allies can follow up fast enough. If you survived, move out of the fight, pop your Wand/Bottle and then look around. Try to use Toss at the next 10 second mark and then wait for full Blink/Ava/Toss 10 seconds later. Whatever happens, if your team could hold himself in the fight, you WILL kill somebody 20 seconds later, Ava/Toss can clear up anything. <br/>2. Assassin. Basically the same thing as you did while ganging. Let somebody else initate (or maybe they initated against your team), look for that lone little evil squishy hero in the rear (there always is. Be it Lion, Sniper, Bane, WD, Rhasta or Zeus, there always is one) and TAKE HIM OUT. They'll be most likely standing isolated, making a perfect target for you. If you can take out Lion before he dumps all his disable shit, your team will fight at a huge advantage. Then just walk in the fight and hit people and get hit.

It is not an advanced guide showing lots of tricky tips and special moves  It designed to get you to understand the basics of how to play Warlock in more of a traditional way", "Because in the early levels Warlock is almost exclusively a baby-sitter (unless you try your hand at soloing), it's best if you share a lane with either your team's carry or tank, which ever one isn't soloing (most good 5-player teams should only have 1 solo lane). Because of the nature of the roles that are played by the tank and carry, they should be given almost exclusive rights to last hitting, while you focus on denying. That said, if there is a last hit you know your lane partner cannot get, then take it by all means. Continue like this until about level 6-7, when the ganking phase of the game normally begins. Depending on your chosen skill-build, you will either be able to dramatically magnify damage from your allies or dramatically reduce enemy movement speed during ganks. Try to make the components for your Mekansm or a Hood en-route to a Pipe. At the same time build either a Wand and Basilius or Urn and Basilius to support your team in fights.", "During the mid game (levels 7-16) you should try to be a part of every team fight you can. Try to organise ganks around the cooldown of your ultimate, because you are so much more effective if you can use your ultimate. If a team fight breaks out and you don't have your ultimate, Upheaval is an adequate substitute, provided you can stay away from the focus firing. Shadow Word any fleeing enemy heroes. By the time the mid game is in full swing, you should be close to finishing your Pipe or Mekansm if you haven't already. When ganking, it is preferable for you to initiate, so that if your team has a dedicated initiator, they can save their initiation skill for later in the team fight. Try to use Fatal Bonds on the enemy heroes before you use your ultimate and Upheaval, so as to give your team the best chance of coming out on top.", "During the late game, the effectiveness of the damage from your Infernals is somewhat diminished, because their damage stats are not %-based. However that is not to say launching an Infernal into a team fight and channeling Upheaval isn't effective. Using Fatal Bonds on the enemy heroes helps to negate the reduced effectiveness of your Infernals. On the offensive, use Rain of Chaos as often as you can to try and help your team win, preferably in combination with Upheaval if the situation permits. On the defensive, use your ultimate more conservatively. Try to get as many creeps killed with Fatal Bond's shared damage as you can because that can save you mana and time because you can save your ultimate for more dire situations. When counter-pushing, don't hesitate to use your infernal to push the lane as fast as you can. With Flaming Fists and Permanent Immolation, you can clear creeps waves quite rapidly.", "Beginner's Guide to Warlock", "playdota", "http://www.playdota.com/guides/a-beginners-guide-to-warlock", "Warlock", "70");

You need to rely on allied disables to get hits in, and your ultimate is only a 1 second stun, which isn't great on just 1 target. It takes some judgment to cast Word to either cast it on an enemy or ally. Note that its CD is usually too long to use twice - this means that if you use it as a nuke, and you get counter ganked, you won't have any real means of defense. Also, healing an ally - rambo heroes in particular like Clockwerk or Batrider - might have a better overall effect than if you used it simply to nuke. The heal can assist in tower diving and/or discourage enemy retaliation.", "This is where Warlock is so useful.

Usually you should wait to catch 3+ heroes with rock drop - when your enemies are ill-positioned and bunched. Because of the huge cast range, it's hard for the enemy to see it coming and scatter away from it, making it one of the best initiation skills in the game that doesn't require a Dagger as compared to other initiators like ES or Tide.", "Infernals", "playdota", "http://www.playdota.com/guides/infernals", "Warlock", "60");

Use whatever you have: Mekansm for your team or Shiva’s Guard for your opponents or Hex the threat. If you dominated a Wildkin,summon Tornado and direct it to the tower. Don’t forget to micro your minions; Infernal focuses tower while Necros focus low mana (preferably STR) heroes.<br/>5v5 Battles (Offensive & Defensive)– Warlock’s defensive and offensive game are always the same, simply Chaos-Crash opponents and summon your minions, not forgetting Fatal Bonds. Micro them and focus the closest or the easiest target for that matter. Since Chaos-Crash is an initiating skill, initiate and have your allies jump the opponents.

Mid isn't the best lane for weaver as it does not have any side shops and you need to build your items from time to time as you farm. So I suggest picking either top or bottom. But if you are forced to play mid then do it. Once you are in lane try to last hit every creep and farm. You need your items to be effective. Note that as said in the 'pros & cons' section weaver has a 'sucky attack animation' so you may find last hitting with him to be a little harder than other carry heroes. But don't worry, with playing more and more weaver games you'll get used to this and farm better. Besides last hitting creeps another important thing is to not forget harassing heroes. Weaver is a born to be harasser in lane and you should abuse that. If the enemy heroes laning with you are ranged try not to get focused by them and harass them when they are trying to last hit. The geminate attack will lower their hp much and in most cases they won't hit back. If the heroes are melee then you should absolutely hit them as much as you can without worrying of them trying to strike back. Remember, Weaver is a 'highly mobile' hero so any attempt of them reaching you will result in them getting damaged by shukuchi.", "By the time you reach this phase you should have done at least one cheaper luxury item. Vanguard is a good choice but I won't re-explain that again. You should start ganking with your teammates and participate in teamfights. Before a teamfight always remember to use 'The Swarm' on a larger group of heroes as possible. They will not attack them while fighting use thus getting damaged. Also destroy some towers, last hit them if you can to get a +500 gold so you can afford your items.", "In this phase you will probably have at least three of the luxury items I mentioned in the 'Item Build' section. This is where you have two choices - either to farm more, get another luxury item and get even stronger or if you're doing well just finish the damn game! Yes.

This hero is 100% timing, and would require NO items if someone were ever to be perfect with him (near impossible, but just to make a point). This is why he's my favorite hero - he's purely skill based. In other words, if you are brand new to dota you should look to swap with someone on your team or repick. I'm only saying this because learning dota with the doc is very difficult when compared to an auto attack hero. This strategy is going to cover the witch doc as an Offensive Hero killer - who has disables for team fights and late game TANKING ability. I play the witchdoctor very aggressively to make use of his overpowered early-mid game talents", "In the early levels, you're going to be trying to last hit and deny as much as possible. I'm hoping that you've read a little bit on this concept, since almost every guide goes over it. I will quickly explain that by getting a feel for the timing of your attacks, holding ALT to see the creeps HP and watching the flow of your lane, you will eventually become good at last hitting. It's basically a discipline thing that you have to be motivated enough to do - as it can be very boring to learn in the beginning. One thing I've noticed is that the WD has a very good attack animation, which isn't too long nor too short. He also has a long range - which makes the doc good at last hitting.<br/>One last important concept about the doc is that hes NOT a push hero, nor is he a spam / harass hero. Focus on getting gold to dominate the early-mid to late-mid game. The doc is a CONTROL hero. ", "Now that we have our basic gear in place, it's time to pick our targets. What we are looking for are heros with relatively low HP (although not required). Also keep in mind, that if your witch doc is level 7, you want to be ganking others around that level. This stays through throughout the game.<br/>Combo casting: Paralyzing cask + Maledict + death ward<br/>Here's how it should play out: <br/>1. You come from behind the hero while he is near his own creeps. Cast Paralyzing casks asap.<br/>2. You calmly but firmly cast Malice on your opponent and INSTANTLY place your deathward close to yourself. (If you place it too far away, you have to walk there. This is precious time where damage could be dealt.)<br/>3. If the opponent attacks you - Don't freak out. You are going to win this fight just stay put. After about 4-5 seconds of your Deathward beating on him you can get up and walk away. He will die. ", "If its not obvious to you yet - turn on your vodoo restoration during team battles. In fact, you can keep it on forever at a certain point in the game - depending on gear. This spell is always helpful. In team battles - you unleash paralyzing cask to control & interrupt opponents spells. One of the huge things to look for as far as interrupts go are: Crystal Maiden, Enigma, and Tree.

You will have a perfect lane control with nice last hits, denies, and you can also harass your oponent with a infinite mana and HP amount due rune control. If you're on top or bottom lane, the procedure is the same, except of the rune control part. <br/>Auto-attacks: You have a nice range, make it worth. Attack from distance and try to land some hits on your enemy.<br/>Casks/Maledict independent of enemy creeps: Against an smart oponent, to place a Maledict without a Cask is not easy, but if you are smart too, it's not difficult neither. The best chance you have to do it is when the guy tries to hit you with an attack or spell (believe me, he will try) and aggro the creeps. When he comes close, just cast Maledict, some auto-attacks, and when he runs, throw a Cask to hold him for some more seconds<br/>Casks/Maledict with 1 creep + hero or 2 heroes: This is the strategy I like most  while your enemy don't senses the danger you provide, he will ALWAYS stay at the little mage side (or on another hero's side). Throw the Cask first on the hero (or on the creep, but on the hero you get 0.5 more stun time) and if you have lv2 Casks, it will bounce twice on them. It gives you enough time to hard hit them while Maledict does his job. ", "Assuming that you already built a BKB, there's no much secret here, just use it smartly. Throw a Cask to bounce at least twice in your enemy, it will assure a safe Maledict cast. Once Maledicted, use BKB followed by Death Ward. With your Casks on level 4, if you find the enemy team without creeps around, get your double kill (if you already have Death Ward lv3, remember that it hits 2 targets at the same time! Or 3 with Aghanim!)!! BKB should be used only while your ult or to escape ganks. At this point, maybe you have some mana left to spend. If so, use Vodoo Restoration always during a battle to assure that you'll be supporting your team while attacking. Use your mana smartly until you get some more mana regen items.<br/>But if you're a supporter, your job is... to support! Always walk with your team, heal them when they need, throw Casks and drop Maledicts, and use Death Ward wisely, cause you won't have a way to protect yourself.", "Nothing much different from Middle game, except that your enemies will be more powerful, but you will be as well with Aghanim and another support items in your inventory.

Thanks to Maledict, he's also a fantastic finisher, with the bonus damage from Maledict able to finish off fleeing heroes before they can get to safety. This is especially true if the fleeing hero(es) has/have been taking damage from your Death Ward. Regarding the sem-initiator, Paralysing Cask has a great casting range, meaning you can cast it from relative safety to briefly disable the enemy heroes to allow your tank to initiate the team fight", "Early game is important for Witch Doctor because as a ganker/roamer, you want to be able to get an Urn and a Wand or Bottle as fast as you can because they will help you out tremendously post-ganks. In lane, try to get a few last hits on creeps to farm up the extra gold for the two aforementioned items, if your lane partner is the team's tank or carry, let them get most of the last hits, but still take a few for yourself. If you are laning with another support, share the last hits equally because likely you will both need gold. Once you get your first level of Death Ward, try to set up one or two ganks with other teammates because you are now a powerful ganking machine. Remember, when you gank, stun, Maledict, Death Ward in that order. Don't be too greedy or ambitious though when trying to score a kill. You are not a chaser and the only reason you can be called a finisher is thanks to Maledict. Don't give chase. If you can't kill them, try again next time. And certainly don't tower dive, not this early in the game.", "During the mid game you should be moving from gank to fountain to gank and repeat. By now you should definitely have both an Urn and a Magic Wand, along with Strength Treads, and be making a start on a Black King Bar OR Ghost Scepter OR Lothar's Edge depending on the enemy lineup. You should regularly replenish your wards because as a roamer, running into half the enemy team isn't going to be fun, so having a chance to avoid that is always worth while. It also helps because as a Rune whoring hero, it's good to know if there are runes with which you can refill your bottle or allow your teams mates to take if they are in need. By the time you reach level 15, you should hopefully be close to finishing your BKB or Aghanim's (whichever you decided to go for).", "Once you reach level 17, you should've finished your chosen channel-protection item and be ganking as often as you can, but make sure that you are not going alone because 1-man ganking will inevitably get you killed when you least want to be killed. Try to gank with your team as often as you can to try and score as many kills to keep them under leveled. If you are stomping then maybe you can go it alone once in a while but don't get into that habbit. If you didn't decide to go for a channel-protection item, you should've gone for an Aghanim's Scepter instead. One way or another you won't generally be able to afford a BKB or Aghanim's, so make it your goal just to get your core items and be happy with that because not all games are going to allow you to farm up. If you are on the defensive, Paralyzing Cask is a great ability because it will hit up to 9 creeps, landing a 5 second stun on each while dealing decent amounts of damage. Voodoo Restoration allows your allows to tank creeps waves more effectively and it also keeps them alive and out of the fountain for longer.", "Beginner's Guide to Witch", "playdota", "http://www.playdota.com/guides/a-beginners-guide-to-witch-doctor", "Witch Doctor", "70");

Despite that, after reading this guide you should be able to understand the hero better and play him proficiently after your first few games a result.<br/>As fore-word to the guide, Zeus, as a hero, is what you would consider a glass cannon. High amounts of damage, able from long range, yet breaks easily upon contact. Because of this, we have to make up for it by positioning ourselves the best we can during fights to avoid focus.", "The majority of the time you play Zeus, it will be as a solo hero in the middle lane. With fast levels, an early bottle and some rune-luck, you should be able to go around and get some kills, gaining map dominance for your team.<br/>The starting build I gave for Zeus: 3 tangos 3 clarities and 3 branches allows for Zeus to get his fast bottle so that he can go around and get those early runes. You should be last hitting with arc lightning and using the clarities to get the last hits, and hopefully have your bottle up for the 2 minute rune. With a rune like an invisiblity or haste, if the opportunity should arise, you may be able to gank the other lanes. If there isn't an opportunity, simply stay mid and try to farm up your arcane boots while attempting to get the rune every two minutes.", "By level 7 you should hopefully have your arcane boots in addition to your bottle, and magic stick. At level 7, as zeus, you are an extremely exceptional hero-killer. With all your spells, arc lightning, lightning bolt and your ultimate, you have over near 600 damage in instant burst potential. You always want to be carrying a TP scroll ready to counter-gank for your allies and the carry on your team.<br/>The next item you want to be picking up would be a force staff. This item is simply an exceptional item on zeus because Zeus is entirely reliant on positioning for survival and staying as far as possible from heroes and staying safe. Force will allow you to play more aggressively in fights because you'll have an escape mechanism if you get caught in a sticky situation.<br/>As Zeus, you want to make sure that you are at every gank and team fight possible, and also be on edge ready to counter gank when they're ganking. Trying to predict when they're ganking and setting up a bait is also a very good choice of action.<br/>Fighting with Zeus throughout the game doesn't vary much based on items. The biggest change to team-fighting will occur when you get your force staff, which will allow you to play more aggressively because of the escape mechanism it provides.<br/>Zeus excels in the early-mid game, so while he does scale into the late game well, he's stronger earlier and as such you should be looking to end the game earlier in general.", "The ULTIMATE key to Zeus is POSITIONING above all else. If you nail that into your brain, you can become a master of Zeus. I have dedicated an entire section of this guide to blast into your head that positioning is the most important part while playing Zeus.<br/>Stay on the outskirts of the teamfights, casting spells at maximum range unless chasing.<br/>Look at the mini-map every time you ultimate to see where the enemy heroes are positioned, and to ensure that you aren't getting flanked from behind<br/>Be ready<br/>Make sure you aren't going to be hit by large AoE ultimates such as tidehunter, void, sandking, earthshaker etc. If you're hit by them, then you are going to become an easy prey for the enemy. You are to stay FAR in the back, away from those.<br/>Use fog, trees and terrain to your advantage whenever possible. Even if they chase you into the terrain, you will be very difficult to kill and you may have delayed them enough for your team-mates to come save you.", "The God of Thunder", "dotahut", "http://www.dotahut.com/guides.php?g=41#chap5", "Zeus", "75");
